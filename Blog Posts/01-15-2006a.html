<p align="justify"><strong>Open Source Development and How-To Protect Your Investment in Time      </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">I am the first to say I am no expert when it comes to Open Source Development because I don't do Open Source Development other than some few simple pieces of code I have published as a way to get my early ideas out the door and into the hands of those who &quot;may&quot; be able to use them.</p>
<p align="justify">If I were going to do a lot of Open Source Development and I wanted to ensure my investment in time was going to be rock solid going forward, meaning I would not want others to waste their time working on my code to make it better than it can be made by myself. I would think my goal would be to spend as much time as possible working on each &quot;product&quot; I wanted to publish via Open Source to make sure the code was as complex as possible and that the code covered as many &quot;features&quot; as possible so that nobody would ever want to spend any amount of time working on the code and so that as many people as possible would want to use the code. The goal would have to be to make the product as useful as possible however or this plan would fail and others would be able to pick-up my code and run with it faster than I could run with it.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the goal I think the Linux developers have used and very successfully. Oh sure, anyone can obtain Linux Source Code and look at it but I have no doubt the Linux Source Code is pretty complex either in terms of the amount of code or the depth of the development required to do serious work with it.</p>
<p align="justify">I too have managed to make certain pieces of my code just complex enough to cause those who have looked at it turn away from working with it in terms of trying to enhance it and sometimes they have chosen to code it themselves however when they want to code it themselves this only means my design was not useful enough.</p>
<p align="justify">All to often I have seen Open Source Developers fail to spend enough time working on their code with the primary goal in mind, that of making the code sufficiently complex to cause other more senior developer not wish to enhance their code. When the primary goal has not been accomplished the secondary goal, that of making the software as useful as possible, is also not accomplished and others may feel the software &quot;needs to be&quot; enhanced in order to achieve the secondary goal which oddly enough becomes the primary goal of all others who wish to use said Open Source Software.</p>
<p align="justify">I have happend to figure-out all this by observation and direct experience. Perhaps in the beginning my goal was not complexity but rather simply the desire to write software because I enjoy doing this so much. I have found-out that it is very easy for me, by now after 30 years of experience, to achieve the goal of making my code just complex enough to cause other developers to not wish to work with it due to the amount of time it takes to do so, I would assume. Now I need to focus on making my designs easy enough for others to use but difficult for them to enhance which means the code needs to be far more complex but easier to use.</p>
<p align="justify">I am not in favor of complexity for the sake of &quot;complexity&quot; but rather I am in favor of &quot;complexity&quot; for the sake of functionality and ease of use and very often for the sake of performance.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>K.I.S.S.</strong></p>
<p align="justify">All too often we as developers are trained to make it simple. Those who are trying to drum this into our heads are those who wish to pay for our talents. I can understand those who pay for my time to want my work to be kept simple because this feeds into their agenda(s) of keeping what I produce easy for anyone to work with. This does not mean however that keping it simple is &quot;the&quot; goal when my desire is to create Open Source Software. The goal in this case should be to make it as complex as possible meanwhile making the code as easy for others to use as possible. Never lose sight of the fact that this will always be a balancing act and it will take a lot of time to accomplish correctly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Some Musings on Mach-II and Model Glue</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I have looked at Mach-II as a framework and the reason I don't use it is because Mach-II suffers from performance issues that I find undesirable. When &quot;Hello World&quot; take hundreds of milliseconds to execute and we all know &quot;Hello World&quot; is a simplistic application to code well the result has got to be that it is time to work on a framework for one's own needs. Mach-II violates the performance mandate even though it does accomplish the complexity mandate for Open Source Development.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>One last point - Update your Open Source code as often as possible</strong>   </p>
<p align="justify">All too often I have seen Open Source Developers fail to update their code as often as possible either because they have wanted to move along to another project or because they have felt their code speaks for itself and requires no additional development. In the beginning I would think the code should be updated daily or no less than weekly. Later on the code can be safely updated weekly or monthly or after even longer periods depending on how long it would take other developers to figure-out how to modify the code to make enhancements. Perhaps the rule of thumb should be how long it might take a skilled developer to figure the code out such that they can begin making enhancements themselve(s). If the code can be used easily to solve whatever problem(s) the code was designed to resolve then other developers will oogle over the code and use it but probably not try to enhance it assuming updates are published often enough to cause them to simply wish to wait for the updates. </p>
<p align="justify">Good performance, ease of use and updates as often as possible should help to guarantee success for your next Open Source Development effort. </p>
<p align="justify">On a side-note, I have made a few more updates to Rabid_BlogCFC just to spice-up the Blogperience of those who visit my Blog. There are still too many pop-ups however I need to take care of some other issues such as getting a faster web server deployed. <a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/BlogCFC%204.0.2%20(Rabid%20CF%20Developer).zip" target="_blank">You will find the latest installment for my rendition of BlogCFC 4.0.2 in the downloads pod</a>, go ahead and download it and use it. If you find-out you need those source files I have encrypted you may make a suitable donation to help keep the lights turned-on around here and to help ensure I can continue pumping out the work I have been doing with <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> and  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>. Of course, nobody is under any obligation to make any donations and I am under no obligation to release source code for enhancements made to Open Source Software. At-least I am making the whole integrated body of work available to those who wish to use Rabid_BlogCFC since it does go a bit beyond the out-of-the-box experience one might get from the original BlogCFC. If imitation is the highest form of flattery then the author(s) of the original BlogCFC should feel quite flattered since I and may others are using it - all I am doing is adding code here and there to make it more useful. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for yet another shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify">Stay tuned for more exciting <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> blog posts as development continues to march right along. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Version 1.0 - <a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/Geonosis_v1.zip" target="_blank">You can download Geonosis&trade; here</a>. </p>
