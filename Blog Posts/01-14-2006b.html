<p align="justify"><strong>Time to Get Rabid over my Web Server(s)     </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">For some time now I have been thinking about which web server to deploy on my web-facing Production machines. I had wanted to use IIS 6.0 because it was supposed to be &quot;the&quot; web server for serious folk who wanted to rock-n-roll on the web. I like being able to adjust IIS 6's settings via the Registry and I don't much like having to reset Apache whenever I adjust the conf file(s). I have been comparing both servers lately with a keen eye on how one goes about using GZIP or deflate to compress content that's served as well as URL Rewriting and the like. The more I looked into IIS 6 and what it would take to minic those things that Apache 2.0.55 does out-of-the-box I have been forced to concede that Apache is indeed the better choice but this is only because I can save $100.00 by using Apache versus the cost of having to buy software to augment IIS's lack of GZIP and URL Rewriting capabilities. It amazes me that Uncle Bill has chosen to ignore these two key features because both are very useful and necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">I did notice <a href="http://www.apachelounge.com" target="_blank">Apache 2.2.0 has been released</a>.  I would like to be able to deploy Apache 2.2.0 but I have a sneaky suspicion that doing so with ColdFusion would require some updated mod_jrun20.so files. Hopefully I am wrong and Apache 2.2.0 will simply come to life when I try to get it talking with my CF Server. The last time I tried, some months ago, it failed to work.</p>
<p align="justify">The Rabid CF Developer just bought a new AMD Dual Core X2 4200+ computer with 2 GB RAM and 320 GB HD which means I can now deploy my old computer which is a 2.8 Ghz Dual CorePentium-D with 4 GB RAM and 250 GB HD and turn it into a monster web server running Windows 2003 R2 and Apache 2.0.55 as well as CFMX 7 blah-blah-blah. This also means I get to deploy a small 2 computer JRun Cluster here at the Rabid   Mad-House. Maybe next month I will break-down and buy that dual CPU Xeon 3.2 Ghz Database server I need to buy to replace my aging Pentium-III SQL Server 2005 machine that has 500 GB of SATA-3 disk space. Buying next year's Production servers this year and using them until it's time to upgrade keeps me as Rabid as possible with the fastest computers sitting under my desk and the second fastest getting used as Production servers. Lost-cost and efficient all at the same time. </p>
<p align="justify">The really cool thing is that the AMD Dual Core X2 4200+ computer has 2 built-in SATA ports (and 4 RAM slots) and enough space for 2 or 3 more SATA drives (and 4 GB RAM) making this little 'puter ideal for either a web server or a database server when the time comes to deploy this machine into Production next year. </p>
<p align="justify">Well there goes &quot;my&quot; weekend. All this new hardware to play with and running out of time to get it all done. Copy files from computer to computer, installing OS's and server software, configuring Apache and JRun, etc. And then just when I think it's 3 am and time to get to sleep it'll be time to switch over IP addresses and see if it all works or not. Ah, such is life when you're Rabid and eager to get new hardware deployed. </p>
<p align="justify">On a side-note, I have made a few updates to Rabid_BlogCFC just to spice-up the Blogperience of those who visit my Blog. I just love coding JavaScript and DHTML especially when it comes to the management of web based content. This time, I managed to compress the Blog Entries down to a single button people can click to read the contents of each Blog Entry, if they wish. I think this cleans-up the home page a bit and allows visitors to get a better look at the various Blog posts they can choose to read if they wish. Sure it means a button click to read a blog post versus having to scroll-down just to see which posts are at the top of the list. I think my solution for this makes a bit more sense than the default behavior. <a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/BlogCFC%204.0.2%20(Rabid%20CF%20Developer).zip" target="_blank">You will find the latest installment for my rendition of BlogCFC 4.0.2 in the downloads pod</a>, go ahead and download it and use it. If you find-out you need those source files I have encrypted you may make a suitable donation to help keep the lights turned-on around here and to help ensure I can continue pumping out the work I have been doing with <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> and  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>. Of course, nobody is under any obligation to make any donations and I am under no obligation to release source code for enhancements made to Open Source Software. At-least I am making the whole integrated body of work available to those who wish to use Rabid_BlogCFC since it does go a bit beyond the out-of-the-box experience one might get from the original BlogCFC. If imitation is the highest form of flattery then the author(s) of the original BlogCFC should feel quite flattered since I and may others are using it - all I am doing is adding code here and there to make it more useful. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for yet another shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify">Development of    <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> also known as <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> is proceeding nicely. I have worked out the final details on how-to bootstrap the system using the minimum amount of JavaScript code possible meanwhile maintaining 100% privacy for all JavaScript used by the system. I have also been working on the design of the AJAX interface and I have found-out it would be quite nice if the AJAX system would allow certain parameters to be made persistent between AJAX Sessions. (The problem of making parameters persistent between AJAX Sessions is in how one chooses to manage these persistent blobs of parms. Then I got to thinking as I was sitting in the dentist chair this morning - named contexts, this might make it less painful to manage the various contexts one might wish to use as one fires off all those AJAX Sessions.)</p>
<p align="justify">Earlier today I was giving some thought to how I would handle the management of Objects via the Object Broker in <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> and the thought ocurred to me that I could use the Session Scope to track the Objects each client currently has in RAM at the moment. This would allow the CF Server to intelligently choose which JavaScript Objects need to be downloaded to satisfy each request for a functionality payload. Functionality Payloads are encapsulations of behaviors that includes a whole body of functionality such as a <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Applet. A <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Applet, for instance, would be comprised of the HTML and DHTML content for the GUI as well as the JavaScript Objects that support the GUI. Both the HTML/DHTML and JavaScript Objects could be packaged into a single JavaScript Object and delivered using the <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> ObjectBroker. Since there may be many <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Applet active at a time it would be necesary to optimize the handling of the Functionality Payloads so that previously downloaded Functionality Payloads would not need to be downloaded unless the actual content has changed since the last time the Payload was delivered. In case the Functionality Payload has been changed and it needs to be downloaded to replace a previous downloaded verison the client would need to be smart enough to know when it is time to remove a previous Functionality Payload from memory to allow the updated Payload to be consumed. This then is the job of the ObjectBroker, handling and managing client memory through the use of versioned Objects that sit on the server either in the database or in a CF Scope of some other storage mechanism the client could care less about. Use of the Session Scope to store the client perspective of those Objects that are in client memory makes sense to me because whenever the Session Scope is retired the cached Object Handles would also be retired and the client would be assumed to be gone. Use of the Session Scope also reduces traffic to/from the database server for cases in which Objects are being stored in a database. Use of the App Scope to actually store the cached Objects as JavaScript content payloads would reduce the amount of memory consumed by the Session Scope. </p>
<p align="justify">Whenever <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> is used to modify any unit of content such as that which is part of a Functionality Payload, the state of the Objects that comprise a Functionality Payload would be modified accordingly. It would be useful to use Notification Services and SQL Server 2005 to automatically cause Objects that are modified in the database to be updated in the App Scope for each server being used to serve <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>. Obviously when there is only a single <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Server the process of updating the App Scope would be quite easy. Alternatively it could be left up to the ObjectBroker's Server Interface to notice when database Objects have changed based on the version number for each object but this model assumes there will be a fair amount of polling traffic between the server and the database. Polling traffic can be reduced by using Notification Services assuming this can be done to interface with the CF Event Gateway. </p>
