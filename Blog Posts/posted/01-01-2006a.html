<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Version 1.1 - The Importance of Designing-In an Appropriate User Log-In Usage Policy.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Not many days ago I was asked, by one of my clients, to code a User Log-In Usage Policy that &quot;limits each user to a single login per workstation&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">My response was to simply code a usage policy that limits each user to being able to use their system from a single workstation at a time. If a user wanted to login from a different workstation the user would need to wait a short time - say 15 minutes (the actual time-out period could be set to any number of seconds including -1 which would simply allow a user to login using a different workstation with no time-out required. I assumed the goal as to enforce a usage policy that would inhibit users from sharing their user accounts across many workstations at the same time which would tend to reduce the number of user accounts their customers would need to purchase and thus the goal should be, in my mind, to make switching workstations somewhat inconvenient for cases other than a user wishing to use the system from home and then hopping into the car and driving to work with the desire of resuming work from a different workstation. It was my feeling it would be pretty easy for users to abuse this usage policy simply by logging in from different workstations in order to share user accounts among several users at the same time. If there were no time-out required between logins that spans more than one workstation users would simply login using one workstation and then login using a second workstation and then login using a third workstation, etc. My client wanted there to be no time-out between logins and so I programmed their system to be flexible enough to allow no time-out as well as any time-out that may be desired. </p>
<p align="justify">Most people who use web based systems will do so from a single workstation at a time. Rarely have I used more than one workstation at a time when working with web based systems. In all fairness, I do own and use as many as 4 workstations when doing my web work however I find it somewhat cumbersome to switch from workstation to workstation when doing my work. If I, as a typical user, bought a subscription to a web based service that specified I could login from one workstation at a time I would expect that service to log me out of one workstation as soon as I logged in using a different workstation - as a minimum. </p>
<p align="justify">What does all this have to do with  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> well it has a lot to do with adding this as a feature to   <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> so that those who use   <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> can define Usage Policies that can enforce a single-user-single-workstation-at-a-time usage policy with the ability to require an inactivity time-out between workstation switches. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will allow site administrators to define how many workstations each user can use at the same time. Single workstation user accounts would probably be sold for less money than two workstation user accounts or three workstation user accounts.   <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> site admins will also be able to define inactivity time-out periods to inhibit most forms of abuse that allow users to script their login activities to allow for fast workstation switches by using a progressive time-out value that begins with (-1) no time-out required all the way up to some maximum value which might be 15 minutes. The greater the number of workstation switches per unit of time the longer the inactivity time-out.</p>
<p align="justify">I think we can all agree that it might be easy to assume a usage policy was being abused if a user who bought a single workstation subscription was switching between workstations after short usage sessions without logging-out between workstation switches.</p>
<p align="justify">Of course, if users wanted to login and use the system then logout and switch workstations then the system should simply allow this without question.</p>
<p align="justify">It is my goal to make   <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> smart enough to handle just about every aspect of web based system usage in an intelligent reusable manner. </p>
