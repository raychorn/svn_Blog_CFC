The <strong>Geonosis&trade; User Manager</strong> allows a Super-User or Admin Role (or virtually any other Role a Super-User might wish to enable for this feature) manually add users to the list of users who can have access to the system.  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> users will need a way to Change their Passwords once their new user account has been created. The ability to Change a Password also helps out with Forgetting a Password. Eventually SSL will be used to help protect the password(s) users will enter when changing their password however we don't want to email passwords around the Internet and for this reason we will email a link a user can use to access their account so they can change their password(s). </p>
