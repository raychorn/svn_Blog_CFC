<strong>Geonosis</strong> Version 1.0 - Adding the User Roles Manager.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The User Roles Manager allows a <strong>Geonosis</strong> User who has the role of "Admin" add or remove User Roles.
</p>
<p align="justify">
What exactly does a User Role do ?  User Roles allow certain functions or features be available to only those users who have the Role that grants access to the function or feature.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Eventually <strong>Geonosis</strong> will allow for many Groups of Users each of which can have their own set of Roles.  Initially however <strong>Geonosis</strong> allows for a single set of User Roles to be managed by a small handful of users.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The design goal now for <strong>Geonosis</strong> is to make is minimally functional for a single small set of users so that individuals can use <strong>Geonosis</strong> to create fully functional AJAX based Web Apps.  Later on <strong>Geonosis</strong> will be updated and upgraded to allow for Groups of Users.  Each User Group will have their own set of Roles and their own set of Content (yes HTML content) and their own set of Web Apps.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Obviously <strong>Geonosis</strong> will have to be able to fully manage HTML content as well as DHTML content.  And yes, eventually <strong>Geonosis</strong> will grow into a very powerful Web Based Content Management System that is also able to produce AJAX Web Apps or Applets without any requirement to understand anything about HTML or JavaScript or ColdFusion for that matter. Someday <strong>Geonosis</strong> may be able to deal with more CGI languages other than ColdFusion such as PHP however initially <strong>Geonosis</strong> will know how to deal with only ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise.  <strong>Geonosis</strong> will be updated to work with the latest version of ColdFusion as each new version comes available.  ColdFusion is a very powerful J2EE platform and so this is why ColdFUsion is our initial focus.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You may think of <strong>Geonosis</strong> as being a 3<sub>rd</sub> Generation Content Management System.  A 1st Generation CMS (Content Management System) would be able to manage HTML based Content only with very little ability to manage JavaScript or DHTML.  A 2<sub>nd</sub> Generation CMS would allow users to create and manage FORMS as well as HTML Content however it would not be able to effectively manage JavaScript or DHTML.  A 3<sub>rd</sub> Generation CMS would allow users to manage HTML, DHTML, JavaScript using AJAX with automatic creation of SQL Code as well as ColdFusion code.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The thing that sets <strong>Geonosis</strong> apart from all other Content Management Systems is the ability to automatically create AJAX code along with bindings for Database Objects which means <strong>Geonosis</strong> also automatically generates SQL Code behind the scenes and under the covers.
</p>
