<p align="justify"><strong>The Rabid CF Developer is working on yet another Enhancement for BlogCFC 4.0.2</strong> </p>
<p align="justify">For those of us who are using IIS 6.0 and Windows 2003 rather than Apache 2.0.55 - I am not saying which is better for the moment although there are some aspects of Apache that are useful and other aspects of IIS 6.0 that are equally useful. I can tell you, on a side-note, that I have both IIS and Apache running on my laptop using the same JRun with both sharing the same web-space but this is a topic for a future Blog Post. </p>
<p align="justify">When it comes to IIS 6.0 and getting Blog Posts submitted to the Google Search Engine the problem seems to be wrapped-up in the fact that most search engines don't like indexing URL's that use URL Parameters such as those that are used when Apache is not the target web server whence BlogCFC is running.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for a really old technique:</strong>.</p>
<p align="justify">Many years ago some of us cooked-up a technique that allowed us to get more search engine exposure by using static HTML files - in fact, many static HTML files - each of which might contain the same content. For the purposes of this particular Blog Post, we shall focus on the fact that each Blog Entry's Content could be placed into a static HTML file using the Alias for the file name. This would allow for easier acceptance from your typical Search Engine without the problems associated with trying to get dynamically generated content into your typical neighborhood search engine such as Google. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for some code reuse:</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I just love to reuse code whenever possible and sometimes even when it's not possible I'll just whip-up some code to make it possible. I found a neat little file in BlogCFC 4.0.2 called print.cfm that seems to be used to render a Blog Entry as a PDF so I think I'll just abstract-out the core of this CFM page to create the means to get the content for each Blog Entry into a static HTML file so I can more easily submit static pages to Google for more exposure for my Blog Posts..</p>
<p align="justify">Stay tuned to this Blog for the updated code as soon as I finish writing the code - hey, it's after 10p by now and I have to get up early to get to work so it's after my bed-time just now. Never fear, I will quickly whip this code up and get it posted to the Downloads Section so you all can download it and begin using it a.s.a.p. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for a shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will use the <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> just as soon as I have completed my work on the next generation version of this exciting AJAX Framework .</p>
<p align="justify">Stay tuned for more exciting <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> blog posts as development continues to march right along. </p>
