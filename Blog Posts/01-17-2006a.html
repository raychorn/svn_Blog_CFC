<p align="justify"><strong>Let me make this perfectly crystal clear <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank"></a> </strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #1</strong>: The code I write belongs to me an me alone. (This does not include code I write when under contract but then I am being paid for my time.) </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #2</strong>: The code others write belongs to them and them alone.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #3</strong>: When I take someone's Open Source Code for which there is NO license agreement or any kind and I make modifications to it I own my own modifications.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #4</strong>: I alone have the right to choose what, if anything, I do with my code. (To recap, my code is the code I write myself using my own two hands and my own computers.)</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #5</strong>: The modifications I made to BlogCFC makes Rabid_BlogCFC into a wholly unique product regardless of the source of the original codebase. If you doubt this point just compare the GUI from my site with that from any site that uses the original unmodified BlogCFC and you will see very distinct differences. For instance, BlogCFC uses very little JavaScript versus the more extensive use of JavaScript in Rabid_BlogCFC.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #6</strong>: The worst kind of censorship is that exorcised by a crowd of thugs. Earlier today a roving band of thugs, however few or many there were, chose to post crap comments to my Blog in an attempt to cause so much trouble that I guess I would have to shut my Blog down or something equally silly. All I had to do was deny access to the comments page and no more problem. After I shutdown the comments problem they chose to post crap TackBacks so I shutdown that one too. Actually I have no idea why Blogware includes comments and Trackbacks when the interface for both seems kludgy and awkward. I certainly don't want people being able to freely post comments I may not find desirable in my Blog all without any controls but whay the hey - I am not the person who dreamnt up the Blogware idea. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #7</strong>: Rabid_BlogCFC will not be published in any form whatsoever. This should make King Camden feel so much better about things since now people will once again have to download his blogware (bugs and all) rather than having access to the enhancements and modifications I have been making. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #8</strong>: If Ray Camden is the &quot;King&quot; of anything then his kingdom must be very small and insignificant indeed. There is nothing noble or honorable about anything King Camden has written about me nor is there anything laudable about anything his merry band of followers has said about me however wrong and incorrect they may be.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #9</strong>: Yesterday I had some respect for Ray Camden but not today and certainly not going forward. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #10</strong>: I am here to stay regardless of what people say or think about me - I am here to stay. <strong>Deal with it !</strong> CF is not the only language I know how to code - I will eek out a living regardless of what language I choose to code. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #11</strong>: Open Source code should be avoided at all cost lest the roving band of thugs choose to visit your blog site as they visited mine. If Open Source code was so great it would not be Open Source and it would certainly not be available for free. I don't code Open Source because I am all too well able to design and code full-blown products worthy of being sold to top-tier enterprises and I don't just toss together code and pass it along as open source. Sometimes I do give code away and when I give it away I allow others to use it as they see fit without restrictions and without repercussions going forward.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Point #12</strong>: Whenever I get around to coding my own blogware, trust me it will blow the socks off King Camden's BlogCFC crap code. I do know how to code cross-browser JavaScript and I am not afraid to do so. Not only will my Blogware not be open source but it will be delivered in such a manner so as to completely hide the source code from all who use it as it should be.</p>
<p align="justify">From what I experienced from the CF Community today all I can say is those of you who visited your disgust upon me and my blogsite should be ashamed of yourselves. Your comments were wrong ! Your facts were skewed out into left field so far you had no idea what reality was. It is not possible to &quot;steal&quot; that which is freely given away. It is not possible to &quot;steal&quot; that which one produces himself. Wake up people before you all turn into the kinds of people nobody wants to be associated with. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for  another shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify">Stay tuned for more exciting <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> blog posts as development continues to march right along. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Version 1.0 - <a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/Geonosis_v1.zip" target="_blank">You can download Geonosis&trade; here</a>. </p>
<p align="justify">Also keep in mind, I am making lots of changes to Rabid_BlogCFC all the time and being the Rabid-One that I am I just don't have time to document all those changes. Rest assured, I am fixing more bugs than I am creating. Anytime you notice a bug you want fixed just drop me a line and let me know what the bug is and I will get it fixed.</p>
<p align="justify">Also I am working rabidly to get my new 2.8 Ghz Dual Core Pentium-D (4 GB RAM 250 GB HD) deployed as my newest CF Server. I've managed to get Apache 2.0.55 working with CFMX 7 Enterprise with mod_deflate working - I have to use Apache 2.0.55 because it knows how to do the SSL thing using OpenSSL and I was not able to find a suitable Apache 2.0.54 with OpenSSL so alas I had to upgrade. I would love to be able to use Apache 2.2.0 with CF and JRun but I don't think the JRun mods work with Apache 2.2.0 and I have not taken the time to craft the OS Service(s) that allow Apache to run as it should and I have not been able to locate the Win32 Installers that perform the .conf magic I would rather use when installing Apache.</p>
<p align="justify">Next on my agenda will be a new Db Server so my SQL Server 2005 will catch fire. I like the 64-bit AMD X2 4200+ I picked-up at Best Buy because it has 2 spare SATA slots and 2 spare IDE bays which means I could drop a 1000 GB in this little 64-bit box and run a 64-bit Windows 2003 R2 and I bet it would be a sweet little Db Server. But... I am torn between doing that or holding off and getting a Dual CPU 3.2 Ghz Xeon - I bet the Dual CPU Xeon with 4 GB RAM would code more than $2500 and I paid a sweet little not much more than $1000 for the 64-bit AMD X2 4200+ and I would much rather have 2 machines for the price of one anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">I will make an exception when it comes time to buying that 64-bit AMD FX-57 I have my sights on right after I upgrade my old Pentium-III Db Server - the last time I priced one of these it was around $2000 with 4 GB RAM and a a set of 10,000 rpm hard drives. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN 1.3.0</a></strong></p>
<p align="justify">I just downloaded the latest <strong><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN 1.3.0</a></strong> and it works great with some nice features, the more handy of which is the upload/download activity indicator that shows how much bandwidth is being used. This version of TortoiseSVN works great with OpenSSL with my SSL Cert running on an Apache 2.0.55 web server. </p>
