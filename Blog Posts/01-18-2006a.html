<p align="justify"><strong>Why do people work on Open Source Code Anyway ?!?   <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank"></a> </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">People, IMHO, work on Open Source code for just one reason. They lack the fundamental skills required to work on real product-level software.</p>
<p align="justify">I have known several unnamed people (in-person) who promoted Open Source  and every single one of them lacked basic programming skills, IMHO. So far I have not met of know even one single person who either coded or used Open Source code who did not lack the skills required to code real product-level code.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Does this mean people, like King Camden, are basically STUPID ?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Well not as such, but I do think people work on Open Source code because they are lazy and slothful.   It takes a lot more effort to design code that can be delivered as a product one would be able to sell for real money than to slap together Open Source code one would just give away for FREE. Not everyone can build real end-to-end products but just about anyone can code Open Source crap and then foister that on the world at-large.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>He stole my code, he stole my code !</strong>  </p>
<p align="justify">Yeah, yeah, sure &quot;he&quot; did... What else did he &quot;steal&quot; - your girlfriend too ?!? - LOL</p>
<p align="justify">Nobody would have to worry about code being &quot;stolen&quot; if we all cared more about producing real products more than trying to claim code we did not write by saying <strong>&quot;but when you add to MY open source code your code belongs to ME, damnit&quot;</strong>.  </p>
<p align="justify">It is funny that someone, like myself, can be accused of &quot;stealing&quot; someone else's code when absolutely NO attempt was made to hide the fact of where the original codebase came from. Every single original comment was left in the unencrypted code that I was distributing. You would &quot;think&quot;, if you had a brain between your ears to think with, that if someone was trying to actually steal code and call it his own that all the original comments would have been removed at-least, yes ? Or was it just easier for King Camden to reclaim his rightful place on his own <em>porcelin-</em>throne by wrongfully claiming that &quot;someone stole <em>MY</em> code...&quot; ?!? Hmmm...</p>
<p align="justify">Where's the proof that any code was stolen ? Credit was given where credit was due. Glowing comments were slathered on King Camden whenever anything was mentioned about BlogCFC other than the original code was buggy-crap that failed to run as-delivered ?!? Or was the &quot;sin&quot; I committed that of having spurned &quot;Jedi-wanna-be&quot; Camden by having actually dared to fix HIS code as if HIS code is bug-free and devoid of area of improvement ?</p>
<p align="justify">I leave it up to those who read this blog to make-up their own minds on these issues. Those who have to &quot;claim&quot; their code was stolen need only be concerned about their own lack of creativity and sloth more than who &quot;stole&quot; their code.</p>
<p align="justify">My advice to King Camden is keep your wife or girlfriend at home where she belongs or I may drive my shiny <strong>Nissan 350z</strong> over and &quot;steal&quot; your woman, as-if anyone can &quot;steal&quot; something they don't really own anyway. - LMAO Rest assured folks my ego is by no means bigger than my hoo-ha and I know how to make a woman moan for more, trust me. </p>
<p align="justify">I had every right to sell my add-ons and fixes for BlogCFC but I chose to remove it because BlogCFC is inferior and <strong>NOT</strong> worthy of being promoted by me.   </p>
