<p align="justify"><strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework </strong>. </p>
<p align="justify">What makes<a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/the-rabid-cf-developer's-ajax.zip" target="_blank">The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</a> better than most other AJAX Frameworks you may have seen around the Internet ?</p>
<p align="justify">Well for one <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> uses an AJAX technique that does not use ActiveX. What ? Did I actually say &quot;it doesn't use ActiveX&quot; ? Well how in the name of everything sacred and holy can an AJAX thingy not use ActiveX and still be an AJAX thingy ? Good question.</p>
<p align="justify">What might be the benefits of not using ActiveX to perform AJAX functions ? For one, more browsers might be able to use it since ActiveX is limited to a select few varieties of browsers such as IE or the like. Mac and Linux/Unix browsers probably don't use ActiveX and hence probably won't be able to use an AJAX thingy that is based on ActiveX.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, most AJAX thingys I have seen don't allow for more than one AJAX interaction at a time with a server. <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> allows for many AJAX server connections as the programmer might desire.</p>
<p align="justify">Most AJAX thingys don't allow AJAX sever interactions to be queued-up and played back whenever the current AJAX server interaction has completed. <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> allows for AJAX server interactions to be queued-up and played back in sequence. In fact, any JavaScript statement(s) can be queued-up and played back upon command - one after another in sequence.</p>
<p align="justify">Most AJAX thingys out there aren't smart enough to automatically switch between GETs and POSTs whenever the amount of data being pushed via a GET exceeds the threshold for safely being able to push using a GET. Typically a browser can push about 2000 bytes of data in a single GET operation before the browser siezes-up and fails the operation. <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> will automatically begin using POST operations whenever the amount of data being pushed exceeds 2000 bytes in a single operation.</p>
<p align="justify">Most AJAX thingys don't or won't allow ColdFusion Query Objects to be communicated back to the calling JavaScript     code. <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> allows the programmer to communicate native (as near native as possible) ColdFusion Query Objects from the CF Server to JavaScript using a JavaScript based Object. So what ?!? CF can already do this, so why does this matter ? Maybe this doesn't matter but it was fun to code anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">Most AJAX thingys don't allow native CF data types to be communicated back to the calling JavaScript code. <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> allows native CF data to be communicated back to JavaScript. Heck <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> can even use WDDX when sending data to the server.</p>
<p align="justify">Most AJAX thingys aren't smart enough to be able to catch and handle an error condition whenever the server has gone offline. <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> is able to allow JavaScript to restart and recover from server related problems. During development the programmer is able to see how much time as elapsed since an AJAX call was issued and there is even a slick activity indicator to tell the end-user what is happening in terms of when the server is busy.</p>
<p align="justify">Most AJAX thingys don't provide for a nice server based debugging feature but <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> provides for the ablity to watch what the server is doing as the server is working using ColdFusion &lt;cfdump&gt; statements, if desired.</p>
<p align="justify">You may notice the <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> doesn't use a JavaScript callback when the AJAX server interaction concludes. Well it does use a callback via an onReceive event or you could program your own callback as you see fit using whatever techniques you may find desirable. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> works across a wide variety of browsers using some very nice techniques that ensures it works even when running with Opera browsers as well as Safari although I have not been able to verify that it works with Safari browsers simply because I don't own or use any Macs.</p>
<p align="justify">Earlier today, although this work has not been completed, I was able to empower a future version of <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> to work using the traditional ActiveX based AJAX methods using techniques that ensures the widest variety of browsers possible with automatic failover to the non-ActiveX methods whenever the ActiveX methods fail. The programmer is able to specify whether xmlHttpRequest() is to be used or not as well as whether GETs or POSTs are to be used. I am still working on getting the xmlHttpRequest() POST working but this is a minor issue to be sure.   </p>
<p align="justify">Hey, I coded the first version of <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> about 6 months before anyone else was even using AJAX. I wanted a way to make the user experience smoother than the then traditional method of always waiting for the silly browser to refresh from a GET or a POST so I figured-out how to do this out of thin air and some investigations on the web for some code I could &quot;borrow&quot;. Okay, so I wasn't the first guy in the world to whip-up this type of code but I have kicked it up several notches and I'll continue kicking it up several notches whenever I get the time to do so. My forte in life is the ability to take anybody's code and make some serious kick-ass improvements. I also enjoy integrating code from various sources into a working coherent new and unique products.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for a shameless plug</strong> </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will use the <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> just as soon as I have completed my work on the next generation version of this exciting AJAX Framework .</p>
<p align="justify">Stay tuned for more exciting <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> blog posts as development continues to march right along. </p>
