<p align="justify"><strong>Protect YOUR Intellectual Property with Rabid_AJAX&#8482;  </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">Use the cutting-edge in state-of-the-art intellectual property protection using <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> ! </p>
<p align="justify">That's right, I said <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> can help you maintain your control over your precious JavaScript-based intellectual property.</p>
<p align="justify">How can <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> do this ?</p>
<p align="justify">It's easy. <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> uses JavaScript to package and transmit data from your server to a browser. The JavaScript you choose to transmit can convey JavaScript Objects to a visitor's client browser. JavaScript Objects remain in RAM and are not cached in a browser's cache. Once a JavaScript Object has been transmitted to a browser it can remain persistent from AJAX call to AJAX call. As we all may or may not know, JavaScript Objects can be composed of data as well as behaviors. The behaviors you choose to transmit to a client browser can define functionality as well as DHTML which means you can easily encapsulate a common set of behaviors that should exist for a limited time, say only as long as a user wishes to perform a certain function such as editing data.</p>
<p align="justify">Why waste processing time on <strong>JSON</strong> or <strong>XML</strong> ?    </p>
<p align="justify">Both <strong>JSON</strong> <u>and</u> <strong>XML</strong> require a lot more time to process than native JavaScript Objects. </p>
<p align="justify">I say let the browser do that which the browser knows how to do. Leverage the power of the browser to serve your needs. Browser can execute JavaScript code pretty darned fast compared to the amount of time it can take to convert data from one representation to another such as is the case with both <strong>JSON</strong> and <strong>XML</strong>. </p>
<p align="justify">Most people will try to tell you to use <strong>XML</strong> or <strong>JSON</strong> for a whole variety of reasons. I mean, sure <strong>JSON</strong> as an acronym sounds kind of cool especially in the way it rolls of the tongue. But all nice-sounding coolness aside <strong>JSON</strong> or <strong>XML</strong> consume a lot of time to process and manage. </p>
<p align="justify">I'll be the first to concede that what I am proposing is simply nothing less than counter-intuitive. We can all agree that we want to push data from the server to a client in response to an AJAX session. Okay and I am in agreement with this concept. But, everything a computer knows how to handle can be manipulated as <em>data</em>. This is a very old but useful concept in software engineering. Treat executable code as data from time to time and you end up with a very powerful and flexiable system in the end.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your JavaScript code in your database along with the rest of the content you wish to manage. You can even store your web content, which includes JavaScript code in an encrypted format in your database where it probably belongs. The only time anyone is exposed to your previous intellectual property is when it is running in their browser and <u><strong>NOT</strong></u> when it is sitting in their cache.  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>THIS</em></strong> is the goal I have been chasing for almost 18 months since I first coded my first AJAX Framework. Until today I didn't know how I was going to code the means to realize this goal. Now I do !</p>
<p align="justify">Every time I hear about or read about something nifty, like the central idea of this Blog Post, I have to give it some serious thought. One night whilst I was visiting someone's site I happened to read about this very concept but as I saw no code posted that I could steal I surmised I would have to engineer this very concept and make it manifest as code and so I began my quest to do just that.  And here you are reading about this concept with no code you can steal and so you are left to try to figure-out how to make this concept into a reality - such is life. </p>
<p align="justify">I have posted the smallest hint of what this concept can become in the form of the <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> prorotype because that is all that will ever be in that form - just a prototype. <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> can now be made into the monster cutting-edge AJAX App Generator and Content Management System it needs to be by leveraging the power and flexibility of <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> and all without the need to ever expose any of the core JavaScript it uses to perform its magic acts. The only problem(s) that remain are concerned with just how much or how little actual JavaScript code I must expose to a visitor in order to bootstrap the rest of the system. From what I am hearing from those who are already using this powerful technique the answer is &quot;very little&quot; - very little actual JavaScript is apparently required to bootstrap an application that uses the <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> concept of hiding and protecting intellectual property. </p>
<p align="justify">All I need to do next is code that little bit of JavaScript and then figure-out how to hide it from curious eyes and hands. I have already coded the core <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> code and am using it to produce real web based software. Just as soon as I figure out how to code the little bit of JavaScript that must be exposed to a visitor so that the mountain of code I need to push to a visitor can be safely tucked away in my SQL Server 2005 database(s) I can get back to work recoding and reworking <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>And now for yet another shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will use the <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> just as soon as I have completed my work on the next generation version of this exciting AJAX Framework . Oh, by the by, I have completed the coding for <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> that supports a cross-browser usage of the <strong>xmlHttpRequest()</strong> function as well as cross-browser usage of the <strong>iFrame/iLayer</strong> technique with automatic failover from the former to the latter whenever the former cannot be used due to browser imcompatibility.  <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> now also features full support for <strong>GET</strong>s as well as <strong>POST</strong>s with automatic switching from the former to the latter whenever the amount of data being pushed in a single <strong>GET</strong> exceeds roughly 2000 bytes.   <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> also features a very nice <strong>slide-out Debugging Panel</strong> that allows for easy debugging of each AJAX Request as viewed from the server's perspective. And the best feature of all is the fact that CallBacks and variabe length parameters are completely optional which means the programmer is completely 100% FREE to use whatever programming constructs may be desirable when coding the server-side of the AJAX system. The out-of-the-box experience is coded to place all calling parameters into a ColdFusion Query Object AND a ColdFusion Struct Object for easier usage by the programmer. Whatever data the programmer wishes to transmit back to the calling JavaScript code is placed into a ColdFusion Query Object which is turned into a JavaScript Query Object that mimics the structure of the ColdFusion Query Object. But get this,   <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> also allows JavaScript code to be transmitted back to the calling JavaScript code which means the programmer is also 100% FREE to hide their JavaScript code within their Application or within their Databases never visible to those who like to sift-through their cache's for little tidbits of code and such. Yes folks,   <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> pretty much does it all for you with 100% Freedom to use AJAX as you see fit. Anyone who wants to get their hands on the source for this AJAX Monster can make a suitable Donation using the Donation button in return for which I will email them the completed code right from my <strong>SVN Server</strong>. It is my goal to make   <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> the absolutely best AJAX Framework in the world, bar none. Any time I read about or hear about any kewl AJAX techniques I might want to use myself I'll add some code to make this AJAX Framework simply cutting edge. And get this,   <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> doesn't even use XML at-all. Which means you get nothing but blinding speed from this little gem. All values returned from the server are communicated in the form of JavaScript which means the same interface is used for ALL AJAX server invocation methods using a consistent interface across-the-board. So you want to use CFC's as your AJAX back-end ? No problem, can do easy. So you want to plug-in some fancy XML coding techniques - NO PROBLEM ! Yes folks, the sky is no longer the limit where AJAX is concerned. And best of all, you can code as many <strong>Concurrent AJAX Sessions as you wish</strong> with no limits other than the available client memory and your available bandwidth . All AJAX operations are <strong>100% restartable</strong> and therefore <strong>100% immune to server-side problems</strong>. Heck, if you wanted to you could even code a poor-man's Clustering System using nothing but   <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> to marshall all the failovers from server to server to server, etc. </p>
