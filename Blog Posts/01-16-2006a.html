<p align="justify"><strong>K.I.S.S. and Development Styles &amp; <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN 1.3.0</a> </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">I have ahd an amazing several days of development, I don't mind daying. </p>
<p align="justify">Once again I was asked to code something with very little idea as to what the code should do aside from an abstract idea but this is the way I like it.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>K.I.S.S.</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>K</strong>eep <strong>I</strong>t <strong>S</strong>imple <strong>S</strong>t_pid, this is the mantra I have been hearing lately and that's all good for those who want simplicity from the code they want developed.</p>
<p align="justify">Once upon a time I worked for a company that shall remain nameless  and I was asked to work with a simple enough web-based portal that just so happend to be composed of 980 MB of CF code. Yeah, you heard right ! That's almost 1 GB of ColdFusion code. Now I am pretty sure those who coded it wanted to keep it really simple because I know I saw the same 5 Queries coded over and over and over enough times to fill-up 980 MB of CF code.</p>
<p align="justify">The code was written simply enough. I had no idea reading all this code. Until one day when the whole shibang stopped working for some odd reason. Did I mention nobody bothered to document this really simple code ?!? Did I mention nobody documented or even knew every single SQL statement that was coded into this 980 MB beastie had to run from a certain user context ? </p>
<p align="justify">Now why did all that the SQL code only work from one certain user context ? Well, it was coded in a simple enough manner. Those who coded this goop knew what user context those SQL statements had to run from. I mean, those SQL statements failed completely when run using the &quot;sa&quot; user account. In fact the SQL statements were coded so that the only table names that were not fully qualified were those not belonging to good ole &quot;dbo&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">To make a long story a bit shorter... this monster web portal was down for 2 days meanwhile I jumped through my keester to make sure every single table name got fully qualified. Oh sure, I could have spent 30 secs getting the system back online had somebody bothered to let someone know how the system was supposed to configured but alas that was not the case. As soon as I realized what was causing the system to fail I set about to fix the problem. Now don't take me wrong, I did notice this problem about 2 weeks earlier and I even emailed my boss who was the main-man for I.T. but I guess he had more important things to do that day so my email was largely ignored. Now, who do you think got blamed for this Intranet portal being down for those 2 days ? Yup, &quot;I&quot; got the blame even though I told my boss about the problem 2 week earlier. At one point I calculated it would take me about 3 weeks of 12 hours a day manually recoding all those SQL statements - that's 3 solid weeks of 12 hours a day of mind-numbing manual recoding all those damned SQL statements simply because someone wanted to Keep It Simple.</p>
<p align="justify">Keeping it Simple doesn't give you robust software no matter how simple you want to make it. I would rather make the code a bit more complex and more robust at the same time meanwhile reducing the maintenance cost.  </p>
<p align="justify">Let me save you all some time here. I was STUPID for not having realized the real core problem with this web portal earlier but in my own defence I was being pulled every which way being the only programmer in the whole company with more work to do than I could handle and I was already working 60+ hrs per week on other issues. Did I mention I was hired by that company 1 short week before they wanted to take a system I was about to code live in Production ? Well that happened 2 months earlier but yeah, I had less than 1 week to come up to speed on a Production system I was supposed to code all without losing any data during the whole process.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Make the Design as Abstract as Possible</strong>  </p>
<p align="justify">On the other side of the coin, so to speak, from K.I.S.S. is the way I like to work when I am writing code. I like to make my code as abstract as possible which means when I realize I might reuse some code I just wrote I quickly build an abstract model that is generally meta-data driven on some level that allows me to reuse the code multiple times without having to code it multiple times. It might appear to those who watch from afar that I may be taking some extra time and &quot;maybe&quot; it even looks like I am spinning my wheels a bit. But, I just finished coding a nice powerful abstract table editor that can be used to edit the contents of one table or two tables or 50 tables with no additional effort.</p>
<p align="justify">It took me about 4 days to whip out this table contents editor but 3 of those days were spent whipping my AJAX Interface together and make it feature rich.</p>
<p align="justify">Just how feature rich can an AJAX Interface be made ? How about it know show to do xmlHttpRequest() as well as hidden iFrames but it also knows how to use a wide variety of those two techniques in an intelligent manner. How intelligently can you use  xmlHttpRequest() and iFrames ? Well if xmlHttpRequest() fails for any reason the code switches to using iFrames. If iFrames cannot be used it attempts to use iLayers. It all attempts to contact the server fails it throws an error but it also calls a time-out callBack to allow the programmer choose how best to recover from the server being down. Whenever the amount of data one wants to push gets bigger than 2000 bytes this AJAX Interface switches to POSTs automatically. All this AJAX action is handled in an abstract manner using a common interface that means regardless of which communications method is used the data flows in and out using the exact same interface with no coding changes.</p>
<p align="justify">Let's be honest here, it is easier to debug an AJAX Interface that uses iFrames now isn't it ? This AJAX Interface I whipped-up provides a slide-out debugging panel that automatically sets the debugging mode whenever the debugging panel is opened and disabled debugging otherwise. This means xmlHttpRequest() calls can be effectively debugged using iFrames because the same CF code is run regardless of which method may be used.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Back to Keeping it Abstract</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The benefits of keeping it abstract are many but at the top of the list is flexibility. People are always wanting to change their minds when it comes to requirements, at least whenever I am around. So when I keep my designs abstract I get to roll with the requirements changes very easily. But then I always try to give the people what they want.</p>
<p align="justify">I have no problems with working this way because when I tell those for whom I work just how flexible my code designs are their eyes light up and they become quite happy all of the sudden. One time not long ago I was asked to code a full-blown content management system and all they gave me to work with from the beginning were the contents of one single web site and the desire to just make it so those site contents sit in a database. Many requirements changes later, after some 4 months, we had created a full-blown CMS capable of managing everything from a single site's contents all the way up to managing the contents for a web portal or a bunch of web portals all just as easily as it could manage the contents for one little site. I leveraged reuse so well that I could add subsystems as easily and as quickly as they could ask me to do so.</p>
<p align="justify">If you want to keep it simple then by all means do so but when I show-up I am going to make it abstract and run rings around everybody else all day long and twice on Sunday. I have a habit of getting the job done and I have a habit of making my code work long-term as well as being very flexible. And best of all, I am not afraid to roll my sleeves-up and get the job done no matter how much code I may be asked to write and no matter how involved the job may become.</p>
<p align="justify">If those who do hire me are happy to have me code it simple then all the better but I will be the first one to let them know under what circumstances their simple code will likely fail and you know what ? More often than not I am asked to make the code robust and more often than not those for whom I work are happier when I do. </p>
<p align="justify">I also don't stop coding when it comes time to switch from CF to JavaScript or vice-versa. From my perspective both CF and JavaScript are all the same language with many contexts. I boldly code CF and then when I can't CF any more I boldly code JavaScript and then sometime later I boldly code SQL Statements and then when it comes time to go home for the day I get something to eat, kiss my wife and then I get up and do it all over again and again and again until the code is done and I get to sit back and enjoy the warmth of completing yet another coding assignment. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for  another shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify">Stay tuned for more exciting <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> blog posts as development continues to march right along. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Version 1.0 - <a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/Geonosis_v1.zip" target="_blank">You can download Geonosis&trade; here</a>. </p>
<p align="justify">Also keep in mind, I am making lots of changes to Rabid_BlogCFC all the time and being the Rabid-One that I am I just don't have time to document all those changes. Rest assured, I am fixing more bugs than I am creating. Anytime you notice a bug you want fixed just drop me a line and let me know what the bug is and I will get it fixed.</p>
<p align="justify">Also I am working rabidly to get my new 2.8 Ghz Dual Core Pentium-D (4 GB RAM 250 GB HD) deployed as my newest CF Server. I've managed to get Apache 2.0.55 working with CFMX 7 Enterprise with mod_deflate working - I have to use Apache 2.0.55 because it knows how to do the SSL thing using OpenSSL and I was not able to find a suitable Apache 2.0.54 with OpenSSL so alas I had to upgrade. I would love to be able to use Apache 2.2.0 with CF and JRun but I don't think the JRun mods work with Apache 2.2.0 and I have not taken the time to craft the OS Service(s) that allow Apache to run as it should and I have not been able to locate the Win32 Installers that perform the .conf magic I would rather use when installing Apache.</p>
<p align="justify">Next on my agenda will be a new Db Server so my SQL Server 2005 will catch fire. I like the 64-bit AMD X2 4200+ I picked-up at Best Buy because it has 2 spare SATA slots and 2 spare IDE bays which means I could drop a 1000 GB in this little 64-bit box and run a 64-bit Windows 2003 R2 and I bet it would be a sweet little Db Server. But... I am torn between doing that or holding off and getting a Dual CPU 3.2 Ghz Xeon - I bet the Dual CPU Xeon with 4 GB RAM would code more than $2500 and I paid a sweet little not much more than $1000 for the 64-bit AMD X2 4200+ and I would much rather have 2 machines for the price of one anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">I will make an exception when it comes time to buying that 64-bit AMD FX-57 I have my sights on right after I upgrade my old Pentium-III Db Server - the last time I priced one of these it was around $2000 with 4 GB RAM and a a set of 10,000 rpm hard drives. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN 1.3.0</a></strong></p>
<p align="justify">I just downloaded the latest <strong><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN 1.3.0</a></strong> and it works great with some nice features, the more handy of which is the upload/download activity indicator that shows how much bandwidth is being used. This version of TortoiseSVN works great with OpenSSL with my SSL Cert running on an Apache 2.0.55 web server. </p>
