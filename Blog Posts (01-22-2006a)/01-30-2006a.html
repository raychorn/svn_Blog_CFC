<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /><p align="justify"><strong>And now the Sad story of <a href="mailto:DKaiser@AllBusiness.Com">Don Kaiser of AllBusiness.Com</a>  </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Don Kaiser, who once worked for <a href="http://www.devx.com" target="_blank">DevX.Com</a> but now works for AllBusiness.Com as the Vice President of Engineering, was asked to create a Content Management System for AllBusiness.Com (his new employer). </p>
<p align="justify">Did Don Kaiser waste his time creating a brand-new CMS for AllBusiness.Com ? Naaaaa. That would have been far too ethical and far too moral and far too costly and far too time-consuming for his tastes. </p>
<p align="justify">Don Kaiser chose to take along with him from  DevX.Com a Content Management System he planned on using to create his own Content Management System for AllBusiness.Com. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>How to go about Protecting the Intellectual Property of a previous employer ?!? </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">The real question here is just &quot;how&quot; should one such as Don Kaiser go about actively protecting the Intellectual Property of his prior employer ?</p>
<p align="justify">Is it &quot;right&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; as well as &quot;law abiding&quot; to take that which he did not have the right to take from his previous employer and use it to enrich his new employer ? </p>
<p align="justify">Using one's own experience is one thing - all professionals do use their own experience to enrich their new employers and employers generally pay good money for this service. But to simply take a software product that one does not own and use that software product in full view of everyone at the new company is quite another thing indeed.  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>We here at Rabid Central are <u>not</u> in favor of this sort of thing.</strong></p>
<p align="justify">No friends, we are NOT in favor of the flagrant abuse of Intellectual Property such as this appears to be. </p>
<p align="justify">In all fairness to Don Kaiser and AllBusiness.Com we should say it is entirely possible that Don Kaiser had every right to use and abuse his prior employer's software product in this manner. After all, there is such a thing as &quot;Fair Use&quot; which does allow one to use a Copyrighted work such as a book or a computer program or the like to learn how to make new products. Copyright Laws were not intended to be so restrictive so as to inhibit Research and Development as well as human progress. </p>
<p align="justify">If Don Kaiser did have such a right to use the DevX CMS he should have made it clear that his intent was to learn-from the DevX CMS rather than to copy-n-paste code fragments from it. </p>
<p align="justify">Openly showing-off a prior employer's software product for a new employer is frowned-upon by those of us who wish to take steps to &quot;protect&quot; the intellectual property of our prior employers. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Most employers have their employees sign NDA's </strong>   </p>
<p align="justify">Signing an NDA is a standard thing these days and we suspect Don Kaiser signed such a document when he was employed at Devx.Com; this would have been standard practice in all probability.</p>
<p align="justify">Once an NDA is signed it generally binds the signer to keep certain things secret from others such as the source code one works on or has access to while employed by a employer such as DevX.Com.</p>
<p align="justify">NDA's are generally crafted using broad enough language so as to make it unlawful for an employee to share detailed internal knowledge from their employer with a future employer. This is not to say some unethical employess, such as Don Kaiser, don't ignore the NDA's they signed once they are offered an opportunity to do so for monetary gain.</p>
<p align="justify">We are <u><strong>NOT</strong></u> saying Don Kaiser signed any such NDA.   We have no direct knowledge of any NDA violations Don Kaiser may have committed upon being hired by AllBusiness.Com. We are saying however that it would have been very strange if DevX.Com had not required someone like Don Kaiser to sign an NDA during his tenure at DevX.Com. </p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, perhaps Don Kaiser was not required to sign an NDA and he simply had unrestricted access to the source code for the DevX.Com CMS and so he took a copy before he left DevX.Com. This is also possible but does this scenario make Don Kaiser's actions correct and ethical ?</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Does one have to be legally bound to do what is ethical in order for his/her actions to remain ethical ?</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Is &quot;theft&quot; actually a theft if nobody knows about it while it is being committed ?</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Is an employee &quot;required&quot; to protect the Intellectual Property of his/her employee even when there is no obvious requirement to do so ?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Common Sense and the Laws of most U.S. States as well as Federal Copyright Law makes it a requirement for all employees to actively protect the Intellectual Property of their employers, before, during and after employment regardless of whether or not there was any requirement to do so.</p>
<p align="justify">Heck for all we know Don Kaiser was freely given a copy of the DevX CMS before he departed to work for AllBusiness.Com. How many times has this happened to you ? Not many times, to be sure.      </p>
<p align="justify">Make up your own minds, friends. We are content to let the FBI and the U.S. Attorney General's Office make up their minds too in the coming days and weeks as we work tirelessly to make sure all interested parties become aware of this possible flagrant abuse of Intellectual Property Laws. </p>
