<p align="justify"><strong>Finally got my new 2.8 Ghz Dual Core Pentium-D Apache 2.0.55 Server in Production  <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank"></a> </strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for  another shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify">This took several days due to my workload and my need to figure-out how to code a URL Rewrite expression with nearly no examples to use.</p>
<p align="justify">As it turns out BlogCFC uses an arcane <strong>undocumented</strong> method of passing parameters which follows the format as follows:</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>blog-url/index.cfm/year/month/day/alias</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The problem is that <strong>Apache 2.0.55</strong> doesn't know what to do this this type of URL using the default configuration that comes out-of-the-box.  I have no doubt the brilliant King Camden knows how his web server is setup and for some odd reason my <strong>64-bit Turion laptop</strong>'s Apache 2.0.54 knows how to handle this URL but Apache 2.0.55 does not.</p>
<p align="justify">So I had to read-up and do some research to figure out an appropriate URL Rewrite rule to allow me to translate the original design from BlogCFC's arcane URL format to one I like better since I don't want anyone to know about index.cfm when it comes time to click on links for Blog Posts and such.</p>
<p align="justify">Now you geniuses out there have to forgive me because I am more than just a little stupid when it comes to regular expressions and such although I am sure <em>King Camden</em> would know this one for sure.</p>
<p align="justify">The regular expression I settled on looks something like this: &quot;<strong>[0-9A-Z]+[\-][0-9A-Z]+[\-][0-9A-Z]+[\-][0-9A-Z]+</strong>&quot;  and it seems to handle the GUID's that are used to form the entry ID for blog posts. Like I said, I am more than a little stupid about regular expressions at this point so I am sure there is a more elegant way to code this silly expression. Just in case my hunch is right and there is a more elegant way to code the expression, keep it to yourself - I don't want to hear from you RE geniuses out there because I got mine working - if my expression breaks then I'll put on my dunce cap and work real hard to fix it albeit in my stupid manner. </p>
<p align="justify">And now the joy of <strong>Apache 2.0.55</strong> (which does OpenSSL around here) and my <strong>2.8 Ghz Dual Core Pentium-D</strong> web server that has <strong>4 GB RAM</strong> and <strong>250 GB</strong> of disk space all connected to my <strong>SQL Server 2005</strong> server with a <strong>Gigabit NIC</strong> no less. What can I say, I made some pretty good money last year so this year I am upgrading my Internet-facing servers. <strong>Eat your hearts out kiddies...</strong> </p>
<p align="justify">Next month I will be upgrading my ancient Pentium-III Db server with a new <strong>64-bit X2 Dual Core AMD 4200+</strong> with <strong>1000 GB</strong> of disk space and <strong>4 GB RAM</strong>. And yes I use nothing but <strong>Gigabit NIC</strong>s to connect my Db server to my web server on a dedicated subnet so don't bother trying to poke around my network for my Db server cuz my Db server ain't even accessible via the Internet. </p>
<p align="justify">Now I can get back to work on <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> and then <strong>Rabid_Blog&#8482;</strong> so I can dump the crap BlogCFC I had to fix and enhance. Don't worry <em>King Camden</em> I won't be releasing either of these products to anyone unless they pony-up some bucks. Open Source might be what you all live for but it is not my cup of tea. <strong>Rabid_Blog&#8482;</strong> will be a very nice demo for <strong>Rabid_AJAX&#8482;</strong> as well as allowing me to launch a <strong>FREE Blogging Service</strong> so I can get my spare bandwidth working for me.</p>
