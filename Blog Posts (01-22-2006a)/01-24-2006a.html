<p align="justify">That's right, YOU are hearing it here first. BlogCFC 4.0.2, produced and marketed by Ray Camden, has Security Holes that allows for Backdoors into YOUR Blog site and it support passive Pfishing.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>We have gotten some emails from people who feel the term is really &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=HPID,HPID:2005-17,HPID:en&q=phishing+definition" target="_blank">Phishing</a>&quot; rather than &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=HPID,HPID:2005-17,HPID:en&q=pfishing+definition" target="_blank">Pfishing</a>&quot; so I ask YOU the reader to consider these Google Searches and then YOU choose the term you feel best fits and use it because quite frankly even Mr. Google is confused as the the correct term along with all those other people who are just as right or wrong as we are in this Blog. Like every word that has even been added to the English Dictionary this word which ever it ends up being will be added through common usage so perhaps the one that is used more often will win. Doh ! </em></p>
<p align="justify">Ray Camden was made aware of the Backdoors but he has apparently chosen to ignore them because we have not heard about any updates to BlogCFC that closes those backdoors. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Backdoors, what backdoors ?  </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">How about a backdoor that allows anyone place Trackbacks or Comments into any site that uses BlogCFC cross-domain.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>WTF did you just say ?!?</strong> </p>
<p align="justify">Any non-Admin function such as adding Trackbacks or Comments allows for cross-domain anonymous data entry with absolutely no resistance from BlogCFC.</p>
<p align="justify">When we brought this to Ray Camden's attention his response was to say that Admin functions require the Admin Role to access functions that store data in a database in BlogCFC. Okay, we dont dispute this - yes, Admin functions do require the Admin Role so those functions are safe from hacking or cross-domain attacks. But, the two non-Admin functions that DO allow cross-domain hacking are &quot;<strong>addTrackBack()</strong>&quot;  and &quot;<strong>addComment()</strong>&quot; and this can be easily verified by looking carefully at the source code found in Blog.cfc which is typically stored in <strong>org/camden/blog/blog.cfc</strong> .</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>How-To Verify that these Backdoors exist and that YOUR site is at-risk ?!?</strong>  </p>
<p align="justify">Do a search in the file named Blog.cfc for any references to &quot;CGI.HTTP_&quot;. If you find any references to CGI.HTTP_REFERER this would be a good thing because these cross-domain hacking attacks could be eliminated by a small amount of code as follows: </p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="-1" cellpadding="-1" class="code"><tr><td>&lt;cfif&nbsp;(FindNoCase(CGI.SERVER_NAME,&nbsp;CGI.HTTP_REFERER)&nbsp;eq&nbsp;0)&gt;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&lt;cflocation&nbsp;url="index.cfm"&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!---&nbsp;this&nbsp;URL&nbsp;depends&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;actual&nbsp;location&nbsp;of&nbsp;index.cfm&nbsp;relative&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;l<br>ocation&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;code&nbsp;---&gt;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;/cfif&gt;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>The code above does one thing very very well. It ensures nobody can access certain functions from using cross-domain techniques. Very simply put, anytime the CGI.HTTP_REFERER does not contain the CGI.SERVER_NAME the visitor would be redirected back to the &quot;index.cfm&quot; page. Some of you may not be aware that it is possible to use winInet to program an anonymous POST that does not have any REFERER which from the perspective of the CF Server the CGI.HTTP_REFERER would be blank as opposed to a POST coming from within your own domain when the CGI.HTTP_REFERER would contain a substring that matches CGI.SERVER_NAME.</p>
<p>Now in all fairness to Ray Camden, he might not even know about this sort of thing so from his perspective it may never have occurred to him to even code a way to keep anonymous cross-domain POSTs from originating from winInet programs. No harm, no foul, right ? Well we don't agree with that assessment and we are holding Ray Camden fully responsible for these backdoors HE denies and therefore he supports their existance.</p>
<p><strong>So as you can see we have explained the backdoors to you. Now on to the passive Pfishing thing.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>What is &quot;passive Pfishing&quot; ?</strong> </p>
<p align="justify">We all know what Pfishing is, right ? The use of illegal means to obtain email address right from your web server or browser.</p>
<p align="justify">Passive Pfishing is a similar technique but it uses passive means to obtain email addresses.</p>
<p align="justify">Whenever someone Subscribes to a BlogCFC site the BlogCFC software will send an email to those people who have submitted their email address as a Subscriber. Along with each of those emails BlogCFC also sends the email address of the person who originated the Comment or TackBack. This means BlogCFC is passively Pfishing YOUR database for email addresses that it sends to the Subscriber. The person using this passive Pfishing technique would only need to sit back and watch the emails pour-in with email addresses that could be used to market back to real people who posted comments at YOUR Blog site without your knowledge or conscent.   </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>So you still think Ray Camden did NOT design these features into his Open Source code ?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">You hve got to admit these these backdoors and passive Pfishing Security Holes would be quite convenient for anyone who knew about them and was willing to use them for less than ethical activities. I mean, it takes no real work to make use of these blatant Security Holes when all you need to do is spend a few minutes whipping-up some winInet code to post anonymous TrackBacks and Comments in someone else's Blog database where it would not otherwise be possible to do so.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>How did we Verify all this ?</strong>  </p>
<p align="justify">Good question. All we had to do to verify all these Security Holes we have been Blogging about was to install BlogCFC and then use it. Hackers did the rest. We have found undesired Blog Comments and undesired TrackBacks in our Blog Database and then we looked carefully at the code and the rest became easily apparent with a little study and some ingenuity. Hackers stopped attacking our Blog right at the very moment we locked-down the &quot;<strong>addTrackBack()</strong>&quot;  and &quot;<strong>addComment()</strong>&quot; functions and denied access to anyone who did not have the Admin Role. Virtually nobody who uses BlogCFC would even think to lock-down their Blog sites in the manner we had to and so these backdoors would remain wide open for anyone who knows about them to use for less than ethical activities.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>We call upon Ray Camden to properly support HIS code and plug these Security Risks now !</strong>  </p>
<p align="justify">This is the real problem with Open Source code that is given away for FREE for all to use. It is just too tempting for Open Source authors to design-in Security Holes they or others can use to gain access to YOUR valuable data. Real companies that charge for their software are regulated by Laws and they have <em>ACCOUNTABILITY</em> for their actions when it comes to how their software works. </p>
<p align="justify">No legitimate company would be allowed to have blatant Security Holes in their code the way BlogCFC does. Why not ? Because no legitimate company would want to assume the Legal Liability for publishing software that had known Security Holes such as BlogCFC does because any company that did produce such a flawed piece of software as BlogCFC would be sued and promptly so.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Would it do any good to file a Lawsuit against Ray Camden to FORCE him to properly adjust his flawed code ?</strong> </p>
<p align="justify">To be honest, there would be little to gain from taking someone such as Ray Camden to court over this because he probably doesn't have any real money or assets to take from him as punishment over these issues. If Ray Camden had any real assets he would be operating a legitimate software company and then we could hold him accountable. The fact is that Ray Camden and all those like him are NOT being held accountable and it is this <em>complete lack of <strong>ACCOUNTABLITY</strong></em> that makes Open Source code such a clear and present danger. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>There is an old saying, &quot;Let the Buyer Beware...&quot;</strong> </p>
<p align="justify">Be doubly careful when the software is FREE because there is NO accountability for anyone to behave in an ethical manner when no money changes hands. </p>
