<p><strong>Announcing our New JavaScript Compiler </strong></p>
<p>During the last several days we have finally come to a conclusion as to how we wish to present our JavaScript code to our user community. We have chosen to use a rather complex method we are calling &quot;JavaScript Compilation&quot;.</p>
<p>Our JavaScript Compiler performs obfuscation which removes whitespace and comments as the first step in the process. The second step is to encrypt each JavaScript file using our proprietary JavaScript encryption system. The final step is to package all the JavaScript code into a single monolithic JavaScript file that contains encrypted and obfuscated JavaScript code.</p>
<p>It is our goal to make it as difficult as possible for hackers and others to easily see our JavaScript code while doing so with reasonable performance.</p>
<p>We are planning on making our JavaScript Compiler into a ColdFusion based product you will be able to purchase Runtime Licenses for so you too can use this exciting new technology. </p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing the web presence for <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our Geonosis<strong>&#8482;</strong> Database Engine and our own AJAX Application Framework. </p>
