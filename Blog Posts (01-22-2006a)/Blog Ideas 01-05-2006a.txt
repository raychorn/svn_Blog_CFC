* Rabid_AJAX - JavaScript musings - Once a JavaScript object is created it remains "alive" for as long as the browser is open
on the page whereby the Object was created.  This just might mean it would be possible to use JavaScript as the
"language" one could use to communicate data from the server to the client with no performance penalty other than
the time it takes the JavaScript compiler to parse and execute the code one transmits to the client.  While JSON
has some interesting points to offer one must still parse the JSON code into usable objects but I say, "why not
let the browser do this for us?".
