<p><strong>New Content from the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry - the Wafer Analysis Prototype (AJAX Sample) </strong></p>
<p>The Semiconductor Wafer Analysis AJAX Sample was created using our latest Community AJAX Framework that closely couples the ColdFusion Server to the Browser Client.</p>
<p>The Semiconductor Wafer Analysis AJAX Sample provides a way to perform analysis on semiconductor wafers based on a specific recipe that defines the dies as they are laid-out on the wafer.</p>
<p>You can find the The Semiconductor Wafer Analysis AJAX Sample in the Sample AJAX Apps pod to the right of this article.</p>
<p>We will be making this Semiconductor Wafer Analysis AJAX Sample  into a product soon to allow those who work in the Semiconductor Industry use our Semiconductor Wafer Analysis system to perform their analysis of their wafers. Complete details about all this will be posted to this Blog once we have release this exciting new online service.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Semiconductor Wafer Analysis AJAX Sample is that is uses HTML/DHTML to display the graphics for the wafer analysis. You may notice the graphical display uses a lot of pixels; we have been successful in generating graphics in the 400 MegaPixel range with very good performance. </p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing the web presence for <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our Geonosis<strong>&#8482;</strong> Database Engine and our own AJAX Application Framework. </p>
