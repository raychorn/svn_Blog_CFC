<p><strong>Announcing our New ColdFusion Runtime Licensing System </strong></p>
<p>During the last several days we were able to create a revolutionary way to construct Runtime Licenses for our ColdFusion applications.</p>
<p>The concept of a Runtime License is simple. Create a way for an Application to be made able to operate in a specific way such that the code is not able to be duplicated on another computer unless another Runtime License has been purchased and installed. This makes it easier for application developers to sell their applications to those who wish to use their code without having to be worried about whether or not their customers will simply make copies rather than buying additional Licenses. </p>
<p>Our idea of a reasonable Runtime License is nothing more than a data file that must exist in order for a ColdFusion Application to operate. This data file contains such information as the computer's name, the domain the application is to operate within, the ColdFusion Application Name and the end-date for the Runtime License along with other information.  The Runtime License data file is therefore made so specific that it only works for one computer at a time. Even if the Runtime License data file is copied to another computer it won't work and the application will refuse to run unless a valid Runtime License data file has been created.</p>
<p>The tricky part about all this is that the Runtime License data file must be made quite impossible for hackers to simply hack and thus create their own Runtime License data files. We have created a technique we call the Oragami Data Folding Technique.  The Oragami Data Folding Technique performs a recursive data fold on decreasing sizes of data pages within the whole data sample. Each page of data is folded over and then subdivided and folded again and again until a suitably small data page has been folded and then the process terminates. This Oragami Data Folding Technique is also reversible which means it is performed backwards to reconstruct the original data. There is no way for a hacker to know just how many times the Oragami Data Folding Technique was used or on what size pages so it should be quite difficult for a hacker to reverse the process in order to reverse-engineer a Runtime License data file in order to make more of them. Rest assured, even if a hacker was able to reverse the Oragami Data Folding Technique it would still be necessary to break the encryption techniques we employ as the first step in the process.</p>
<p>We plan on publishing an online service that allow software publishers to buy Runtime License data files from us which they will be able to use when publishing their own software products.  </p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing the web presence for <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our Geonosis<strong>&#8482;</strong> Database Engine and our own AJAX Application Framework. </p>
