<p><strong>Is this how low the ColdFusion Community has sunken ? To  support &quot;<a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/1/17/CF-developer-with-30-years-of-horrible-experience" target="_blank">Black Listing</a>&quot; people ?!? </strong></p>
<p>One word of advice to those who find themselves believing  that they read on the Internet... 99% of everything published on the Internet  is probably FALSE. You can bet the probability of falsehood rises significantly  when reading Blogs.</p>
<p>If someone like this Ray Horn character, whomever he is, can  be Black Listed then surely anybody else in the world can be Black Listed too.</p>
<p>What would stop this vigilante mob from Black Listing YOU or  YOUR COMPANY ? Ask yourself this. </p>
<p>If we as a society allow people such as Ray Horn, whomever  this poor soul must be, to be Black Listed then there is nothing to stop YOU or  YOUR company from being Black Listed just as easily. </p>
<p>Black Listing should have gone out with the McCarthy era in  this country (USA)  and it should have gone out with everything that was bad about the 20th Century  but apparently it has not. </p>
<p>Those who wish to support Gay Rights, for instance, should  be very concerned about what is being done to Ray Horn - not that Ray Horn is  gay, we don't even know who this person is let alone what his sexual preference  may be. Our point on this is that if bashing White folks (we are assuming Ray  Horn is a W.A.S.P.) become legitimate then there would be nothing to stop vigilante  groups from bashing Gays on the Internet. There would be nothing to stop vigilante  groups from Black Listing Colored people or Hispanics or Europeans or any other  minority groups. In this case, Ray Horn is obviously a minority group of one  person but the principle is the same. Isn't it ?</p>
<p>OR we do just turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to this sort  of thing and laugh at those who we choose to pick on as a Society all the while  telling ourselves we are a Great Society that bands together to spread lies and  innuendo about those who are not able to protect themselves ?!?</p>
<p>Who will fall victim to those who are bashing Ray Horn on  the Internet after this poor fellow has been banned from the ColdFusion  Community ? </p>
<p>Who will this vigilante group choose to attack next ?</p>
<p>Will they be happy to only go after certain individuals OR  will they next launch an attack against YOUR COMPANY or against YOU ?!?</p>
<p>We who publish this Blog have to wonder where this will lead  us as a Society. We have to wonder if this desire to single certain people out  on the Internet won't lead us all down the path of anarchy and chaos we as  reasonable and responsible adults have been fighting for millennia. </p>
<p>Give this some serious thought folks, before it is too late. </p>
