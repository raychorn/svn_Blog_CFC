<p align="justify"><strong>Beware of BlogCFC (author Ray Camden) - HE designed many security holes and back-doors anyone can walk thru !    <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank"></a> </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">Shame on YOU Ray Camden ! Shame on you very much.</p>
<p align="justify">Anyone who wants to gain access to YOUR Blog (assuming you are STUPID enough to actually use BlogCFC) simply by using the built-in HACKER's interface as-designed by the original author &quot;Ray Camden&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">I have been working on locking-down my Blog and I am STUPID enough to use BlogCFC and wouldn't you know it... Somebody has been hacking into my Blog as Admin placing unwanted TackBacks  into my Blog.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>So I looked at the source code again and this is what I found.</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style1"><strong>(1). The file named blog.cfc was coded with a lot of &lt;cffunction&gt; definitions that allow &quot;remote&quot; access. Why ? Because coding CFC functions this way allows for remote access such as a HACKER might wish to use to gain access to someone else's Blog as Admin. There is no reason to code CFC functions this way otherwise.</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style2"><strong>(2). The file named blog.cfc was code to allow anyone who has access using (1) to SPOOF as Admin because the Administrative functions do NOT disallow access when the user is not in the Administrative Role. This means anyone who has the source code can SPOOF as Admin to do anything they desire in your Blog. </strong></span></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>(3). Even when the GUI has been locked-down a HACKER who has the source code for BlogCFC can still gain access to YOUR Blog to do whatever they desire.</strong></p>
<p align="justify" class="style2"><strong>(4). Ray Camden designed BlogCFC in this manner to allow him or his supporters to control every single site that uses BlogCFC remotely. If you wish to deny this then look at the source code very carefully and then YOU decide on your own.</strong></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>(5). This IS the problem with Open Source Code - it is far too wasy for the Author to quietly code-in backdoors and spoofing channels others can use to gain access to whatever they wish.   </strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>(6). <u>DO NOT TRUST</u> ANY CODE RAY CAMDEN PRODUCES ! </strong></p>
<p align="justify">If <strong>YOU</strong> want detailed information related to locking-down your copy of BlogCFC just <strong>make a $100 donation</strong> by clicking that donation button and I will respond with a detailed list of changes you should make to your Blogware. For a <strong>$200 donation</strong> you get compiled CF Code that contains all the lock-downs already installed.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, if you are using BlogCFC then YOUR Blog <strong><u>can</u> be hijacked</strong> by just about anyone who wants to do so.  </p>
