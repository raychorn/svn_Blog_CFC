<p>Would it be possible to deploy the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise in such a manner so as to eliminate the cost one would normally have to pay to purchase a runtime License for ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise ? </p>
<p>We all know that the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise supports 2 clients at a time. This is the limitation Macromedia (now Adobe) built into this product originally. Typically this limitation would keep people from being able to deploy the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise to act as a Production level server capable of handling requests from many users at a time. Typically this would be correct and valid.</p>
<p>Now imagine what happens if some smart developer were to construct a system capable of allowing a single FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise  Server to be used by as many users at a time that the official License of same would support. Might this be possible ?</p>
<p>The only limitation on this sort of thing would be how quickly the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise Server could react to a request so the next virtual request could be processed. Hmmm... Now imagine what happens if the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise Server were deployed on more than one physical server. Let's say you have a system such as  <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> that supports making many physical servers act as one single super-computer server. Let's say then that the problem of handling virtual requests fast enough becomes less of a problem because now there would be 4 physical users able to hit 2 physical servers both of which have the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise Server installed.</p>
<p>Does this problem become easier or harder once AJAX is factored into the equation ? Would the use of AJAX allow the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise Server to be used in this manner with reasonable response times ? One would be tempted to conclude the answer to this must be interesting enough to investigate.</p>
<p>It would seem the only real problem then becomes how to architect such an interface so as to allow the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise Server to be used across many virtual AJAX calls spread across many physical web servers clustered together using <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Of course, one would have to pay attention to the details of the actual system that allows this problem to be resolved. Perhaps nothing more complex than a smart proxy that queues-up AJAX calls and executes them one at a time using the next available physical server that is able to handle a virtual ColdFusion Request. Oops, we've given too much about this design away now haven't we ?</p>
<p>I would recommend that Adobe rethink how they plan to release the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise Server because anyweb based CGI platform that allows even a single physical IP address to connect at a time would be fair game for a carefully crafted AJAX based solution that provides the means of intelligently proxying physical requests from many people through some sort of queued process such as is being suggested in this blog post. </p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing the web presence for <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our Geonosis<strong>&#8482;</strong> Database Engine and our own AJAX Application Framework. </p>
