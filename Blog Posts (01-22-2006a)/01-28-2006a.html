<p align="justify"><strong>The RABID One has successfully created the means to Protect JavaScript based Intellectual Property ! </strong></p>
<p align="justify">This will change the way we all develop and distribute JavaScript via web Browsers forever ! </p>
<p align="justify">Without revealing any details, let's just say we have developed a way to deliver JavaScript to the browser in a manner that keeps the actual JavaScript source code hidden from curious eyes. </p>
<p align="justify">In the days and weeks that follow we will convert the rest of our <strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> Framework to use this new model and then we will create a sample Application that highlights how this new model works all without revealing our valuable JavaScript code. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Intellectual Property Protection for JavaScript   </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">Imagine a day when YOU can feel free to develop JavaScript that runs in a browser without having to worry about how you are going to keep your hard work secret from others meanwhile allowing others to use your valuable code.</p>
<p align="justify">Around here we are beginning to feel like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=HPID,HPID:2005-17,HPID:en&q=John+Lennon" target="_blank">John Lennon</a> who wanted us all to &quot;Imagine&quot; a better world. Well we here at RABID Central want you all to &quot;Imagine&quot; a better world for JavaScript development.</p>
<p align="justify">Very soon you too will be able to develop JavaScript and distribute it all without ever allowing anyone to get a look at your JavaScript code. YOU will be able to use ColdFusion, for instance, as a way to <strong>package</strong> your web apps in an encrypted form. Those of us who are familiar with ColdFusion know it is possible and desirable to distribute ColdFusion applications in an encrypted form. <strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> will make it possible for YOU to package your JavaScript based web apps in an encrypted form and deliver your web apps to those who wish to use them without ever allowing anyone to ever look at your JavaScript code. </p>
<p align="justify">Typically JavaScript code is delivered to a web browser in the form of a file, a source file. The JavaScript source file is then downloaded to the browser where it will be cached for later use. Caching is both a good and bad thing. Caching is a good thing because once the file is cached it will speed the web app by keeping the already cached files from being downloaded again and again. Caching is a bad thing because people can easily view the contents of all cached files thus allowing them to read your source code to see how you are doing things. Sure it is possible to obfuscate JavaScript code to make it more difficult for people to read the source files but obfuscation is not the best way to keep your JavaScript code safely hidden from view. The best way to keep your JavaScript source code hidden from view is to use <strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> to keep your JavaScript from ever getting to the browser's cache.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> will use its own caching method to reduce the bandwidth requirements for your web app as it is being served to your site's visitors. Personally, I would rather use a little more bandwidth to keep my valuable JavaScript hidden from view, if I had the option of doing so. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> will also make it possible to deliver web apps that use ColdFusion or any other CGI language via <strong>.html</strong> files rather than <strong>.cfm</strong> files or <strong>.php</strong> files or the like. Oh sure, you could use the Apache web server and setup a URL Rewrite Rule that hides the fact that you are using ColdFusion or PHP while allowing search engines to be optimized through the use of static-looking URLs that don't use URL parameters - you should still do this anyway even when using <strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong>. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> makes it possible to completely hide the underlying server-side systems from view by making it possible to use nothing but <strong>.html</strong> files that have nothing but HTML in them. Some people have found that they can put their ColdFusion code into <strong>.html</strong> files which can also make it look like ColdFusion is not being used however this is not the same thing as actually hiding ColdFusion from view, for instance.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> is the wave of the future.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> is the AJAX system <u><strong>YOU</strong></u> will want to use.   </p>
<p align="justify">Go ahead and make a suitable <a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/" target="_blank">Donation</a> now... doing so will help us continue to develop <strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> meanwhile placing your name closer to the top of the list of those we will consider selling Run-time Licenses to for <strong>RABID_AJAX&#8482;</strong> once it becomes a properly encrypted ColdFusion web app we can sell for mass use. We still have a lot of work to do but we have taken the first step today towards that goal. </p>
