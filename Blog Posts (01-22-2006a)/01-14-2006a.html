<p align="justify"><strong>Several Useful Updates for Rabid_BlogCFC 4.0.2    </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">I really dislike pop-up windows especially when they don't seem to match the flow of the work being done or they tend to fail to format correctly based on their content. This being said, I have removed the Blog Editor, Comments Editor and Category Editor pop-up windows and replaced them with DHTML panels that magically appear and disappear all without any pop-ups at all. I may not like pop-up windows but I do like coding JavaScript every single chance I get. </p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://rayhorn.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/BlogCFC%204.0.2%20(Rabid%20CF%20Developer).zip" target="_blank">You will find the latest installment for my rendition of BlogCFC 4.0.2 in the downloads pod</a>, go ahead and download it and use it. If you find-out you need those source files I have encrypted you may make a suitable donation to help keep the lights turned-on around here and to help ensure I can continue pumping out the work I have been doing with <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> and  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>And now for yet another shameless plug</strong> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>, an up and coming future product, uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify">Development of    <strong>The Rabid CF Developer's AJAX Framework</strong> also known as <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> is proceeding nicely. I have worked out the final details on how-to bootstrap the system using the minimum amount of JavaScript code possible meanwhile maintaining 100% privacy for all JavaScript used by the system. I have also been working on the design of the AJAX interface and I have found-out it would be quite nice if the AJAX system would allow certain parameters to be made persistent between AJAX Sessions.</p>
<p align="justify">I have been using <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> to create my first real operational application that edits and maintains the contents of several database tables. When it comes time to perform certain sub-functions such as committing an edited record back to the database it would be useful to not have to reissue the list of arguments that were previously issued to establish the operational context for the AJAX Sessions that are part of the same area of functionality. For instance, several functions such as adding a record as well as saving and deleting records all share one thing in common - the callBack JavaScript function. The common callBack function for all these functions does the same thing - namely to simply refresh the list of records along with the GUI elements that are used to edit the data. It would make for an easier to code application if I didn't have to jump through huge hoops just to get the parameters passed around to all the various AJAX Session invocation points although the same goal could be accomplish by using a global data structure of some kind to store the commonly used parameters I would rather build this into the AJAX API so that a <strong>context</strong> could be established and used until a different context is needed. </p>
<p align="justify">I have also decided to build into <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> an Object Broker. An Object Broker would be responsible for maintaning a list of JavaScript Objects that have been previously downloaded from the server. Since there is no need to continuously download the same Objects over and over when moving from one functional area to another it would be more optimal to create an Object Broker. The Object Broker will communicate the list of previously downloaded Objects to the server wheneve an AJAX function is initiated. The server will then figure-out which objects to download to the browser based on those functions that were previously downloaded and those Objects that must be present in the client to support the functionality being downloaded to the client. The Object Broker will ensure the same Objects are downloaded only once unless the Object has changed since the last time it was downloaded from the server. Each Object will have a serial number that defines the date and time the Object was checked-into the system. Each time an Object is updated the serial number is adjusted. Whenever an Object's serial number in the Server differes from that found in the client the updated Object will be downloaded as-needed to the client during the next AJAX Session.</p>
<p align="justify">Because <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> is meant to be the foundation for a Content Management System it may be advantageous to manage HTML Content and Data using the same technique as an Object Broker but for HTML content or XML content or raw data which is also a form of content.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> will allow web based applications to become completely dynamic for both JavaScript (which is typically considered static - downloaded once for each page invocation but non-changing while the page is sitting in the browser no matter how long the page is sitting in the browser) and HTML content. The ablity to turn JavaScript into a dynamic form of content will truly make <strong>Rabid_AJAX&trade;</strong> into a unique product, at least this is the hope I have as the designer and architect.  </p>
<p align="justify">Stay tuned for more exciting <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> blog posts as development continues to march right along. </p>
