<p align="justify">The Open Source concept was created by those who lack the abilities or the desire to spend the time working on real products because coding real products take time and energy and desire and committment. Mainly it takes creativity and resourcefulness. Open Source advocates are not willing to do the hard work required to make real products come to fruition. Open Source provides a way for slothful Bart Simpson types to try to gain some fame they would otherwise be denied. Open Source fosters the desire to lay claim on code others write simply because they feel all code related to open source becomes open source. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Once upon a time...</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I tried to craft an Open Source License that would allow me to legally lay claim to the work others did on my wanna-be Open Source project and I tried to do this at SourceForge but my supposed License Agreement was rejected and rightfully so. I was told that my desired to lay claim to the code others produced for my Open Source project was not in keeping with the spirit of Open Source. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Was SourceForge wrong or were they right ? </strong></p>
