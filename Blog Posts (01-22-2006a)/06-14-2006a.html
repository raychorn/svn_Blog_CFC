<p>During the past 2 weeks we have been working to create our first sample site for <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong>.</p>
<p>You can test drive our <strong>ezAJAX&#8482; Blog</strong> by <a href="http://rabid.contentopia.net/blog" target="_blank">clicking here</a> and then click the button to enter our exciting new <strong>ezAJAX&#8482; Blog</strong>.</p>
<p>It was very easy to recode our entire non-AJAX Blog to use <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;.</strong></p>
<p>Our task now is to make <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> into a product everyone can use to code their AJAX Applications. Stay tuned to this Blog to get your first look at the <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> Product. </p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing the web presence for <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our Geonosis<strong>&#8482;</strong> Database Engine and our own AJAX Application Framework. </p>
