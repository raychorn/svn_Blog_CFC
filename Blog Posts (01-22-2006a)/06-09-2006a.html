<p><strong>Announcing our New ezAJAX&#8482; Product  - AJAX the EZ Way  </strong></p>
<p>During the past 24 months we have been working in secret to produce a revolutionary AJAX Framework we are calling <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> makes it EZ to make JavaScript work every bit as powerfully as ColdFusion does. With <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> you can queue-up ColdFusion Query Objects that are transmitted back to the client when the AJAX Server Call terminates. It is very easy to queue-up as many ColdFusion Query Objects as are desired during an AJAX Server Call.</p>
<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> makes is EZ to download data from your SQL Server to a client browser where Queries can be run against that data using JavaScript - this reduces the load on your ColdFusion server and it reduces the amount of data that must be downloaded to the client. You can easily architect <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> Applications that only connect with the AJAX Server to download data and then to upload changes to that data rather than using the traditional technique that downloads content and data from the server for every page hit regardless of what the user does with that data. </p>
<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> makes it EZ to use the XMLHttpRequest() or the &lt;iFrame&gt;  AJAX Server Interfaces interchangably and dynamically which means if your preference is to use XMLHttpRequest() the <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> <strong>Framework</strong> will make every known attempt to utilize your preference however in cases where the client browser is not able to use the preferred method <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> will automatically switch to use the &lt;iFrame&gt; method and if that is not possible then the &lt;iLayer&gt; method will be used.</p>
<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> makes it EZ to produce high-powered AJAX Applications that can be distributed using our new Runtime Licensing System that allows you, the software publisher, create Limited-Use Runtime Licenses that are virtually unhackable. You can decide how to best limit the use of your AJAX Applications by limiting the features that are available to the end-user or to limit the period of time the application can be used or both. Additionally as part of the <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> product you will be able to deploy a web based system that automatically creates a Runtime License when your end-user installs your code onto their server using our Application Installation System. You can choose to limit a Runtime License to a phyiscal server using a unique ID that was generated for that server or to a single domain using either a domain name or a wildcarded domain name in addition to the period of time or limited set of features. This allows you, as the software publisher, to distribute your AJAX Application as a Try-before-you-Buy FREE Download or an Enterprise Level Application or anything in between all with a single Runtime License file that can easily be upgraded by the end user under your control. </p>
<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> also provides access to our new JavaScript Compiler that obfuscates your JavaScript by removing extra whitespace before compiling your obfuscated code using our unique JavaScript Encryption Technique that makes it very difficult for hackers or software pirates to simply steal your valuable JavaScript code unless they choose to spend a lot of their time reverse-engineering the compiled code back into JavaScript source code. This helps to protect your Intellectual Property by making it very difficult to simply view your code to see how you are doing things.</p>
<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> reduces the amount of code you would otherwise have to code to get your AJAX Application developed and released. It was very easy for us to rearchitect our original Blog using <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> with the result being that there was much less code written once this Blog was recoded to use the <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> API.</p>
<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> makes it very easy to create and deploy fully functional Application Prototypes. Recently we used <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> to create a fully functional Semiconductor Wafer Analysis System that was minimally functional in less than 3 business days.   </p>
<p>There are many more features built into <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> and we will publish a complete product offering soon as well as an updated AJAX based Blog that uses <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong></p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing the web presence for <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our Geonosis<strong>&#8482;</strong> Database Engine and our own AJAX Application Framework. </p>
