<p><strong>ezAJAX&#8482; Community Edition Framework Documentation is now being written </strong></p>
<p>We are in the process of drafting the  <strong>ezAJAX&#8482; Community Edition Framework Programmer's Guide</strong> and at the same time refactoring the Framework to make it into the product it was meant to become. Up until now we have been playing with the prototype of the framework to ensure it would be useful to those who wished to quickly code their own AJAX Apps with little programming effort.</p>
<p>Stay tuned and return here often to get your first look at the  <strong>ezAJAX&#8482; Community Edition Framework Programmer's Guide</strong> once it is ready to be published. </p>
<p>And now a word from our sponsors... </p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> and is powered by <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing our web presence for <strong>ezAJAX&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our <strong>Geonosis&#8482;</strong> Database Engine. </p>
