<p><strong>A new FireFox (1.5.0.3) was just released so we had to revamp our JavaScript Code Obfuscator a bit - Success   ! </strong></p>
<p>The latest FireFox caused us a bit of a technical problem because it was able to show users our JavaScript code even though we were going to great lengths to keep our JavaScript code out of your browser's cache. It seems IE 6.x was playing by the rules and abiding by our wishes to keep our JavaScript code out of your browser's cache but FireFox was not.</p>
<p><strong>So we had to revamp our JavaScript Obfuscator a bit.</strong>  </p>
<p>Been there, done that ! Been there again and done that again but now, or soon anyway, our JavaScript code will be sufficiently obfuscated once again.</p>
<p>Along the way we found out that FireFox has a minor bug. *Gasp* FireFox has a minor bug, so what - get over it. What's the minor FireFox bug we need to discuss as this point ? FireFox can't properly show you hackers out there, yeah YOU know who YOU are, large globs of JavaScript that seem to occupy a lot of bytes in a single string. Well this may be more of a problem for the person(s) who coded the FireFox extension we found that shows JavaScript code for a web page. In any case, we are using this bug to our benefit by making sure our JavaScript Obfuscator creates large globs of seemingly useless goo the browser is asked to make sense of at run-time but there you have it now our JavaScript code is once again nicely obfuscated. It only took our crafty software engineering staff a couple hours to figure this out but kudos to you guys, you are the best ! Of course would-be hackers would have to ignore the fact that we also use state-of-the-art SDA techniques for making it a bit harder to see and copy our JavaScript code once they load-up our dynamicaly created pages. </p>
<p>This Blog is currently running on <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong>. Just give it a test-drive and then get ready to download and experience <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> for yourself. In the meantime we are developing the web presence for <strong>ezCluster&#8482;</strong> which will be based on our Geonosis<strong>&#8482;</strong> Database Engine and our own AJAX Application Framework. </p>
