<p align="justify">That's right, you're reading this here first. Ray Horn is no longer associated with this site and will be moving along with his $1.5 mil payment for this site.</p>

<p align="justify">You can expect the hard-hitting articles to continue to appear from time to time and we, the new owners, will be publishing all the works of the previous owner, Ray Horn, for as long as he is able to produce software.  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Q: What are Ray Horn's plans for the future ? </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">We cannot tell you what Ray Horn's plans might be other than he mentioned something about wanting to travel abroad for the next 18 months to see the sights around the world during which time he has made several committments to us for certain pieces of content which we will publish as they become available.</p>
