<p align="justify"><strong>Update for the <a href="http://rabid.contentopia.net/blog/downloads/GeonosisPrototype_v1.zip" target="_blank">GeonosisPrototype_v1.Zip</a> </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Finally got around to going over this code one more time.</p>
<p align="justify">Made some improvements and removed some errant code.</p>
<p align="justify">We now have a <a href="http://geonosis.contentopia.net/geonosis/" target="_blank">test site</a> so you can see that this code does indeed work as advertised.   Some few folks may have encountered some problems with getting the previous distributions to work correctly. In case you encounter any problems just go ahead and play with the <a href="http://geonosis.contentopia.net/geonosis/" target="_blank">test site</a> that does run on our servers. </p>
<p align="justify">We are in the process of further refining the Geonosis&#8482; Database Engine by creating some ColdFusion CFC Objects to help in the process of manipulating Geonosis&#8482; Objects.</p>
<p align="justify">Just to recap, Geonosis&#8482; in a Web based AJAX-powered Content Management System and Application Generator that uses the Geonosis&#8482; Database Engine. The Geonosis&#8482; Database Engine turns SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005 into an Object-Oriented Networked Database that allows for ad-hoc data to be stored and manipulated with complete ease without the need to code or know SQL. </p>
