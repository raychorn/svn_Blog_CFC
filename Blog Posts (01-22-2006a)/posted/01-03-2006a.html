<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Version 1.1 - The Value of Developing in a Sandbox.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Sandbox development. What is it ?.</p>
<p align="justify">Sandbox development, for me, is the ability to develop code virtually anywhere - in a virtual website or in a folder hanging off the webroot sitting in my laptop. If at all possible I try to code without the use of Mappings so that my code can run in any Sandbox I may choose to run it in. If at all possible I try to code without specific references to CFC's. </p>
<p align="justify">What ? No Mappings ? Is this <strong>heresy</strong> or just lunacy ? Well when no Mappings are used then no custom tags are being used - at least not the custom tags that require Mappings. Nope, I don't use custom tags at all. Haven't used custom tags since CFMX 6.1 when I switched to coding a lot of &lt;cfscript&gt; code instead. Back when custom tags <u><strong>had</strong></u> to be coded then I coded custom tags until well after the cows came home each night. Not long after I found out my ColdFusion code compiled faster when I used a lot of &lt;cfscript&gt; code I began coding more &lt;cfscript&gt; code than not. When I began to learn that &lt;cfscript&gt; code was more like Java than not I coded even more &lt;cfscript&gt; code. And when I learned that &lt;cfscript&gt; code was far more powerful than the old fashioned tag script I began to learn how to code just about everything using &lt;cfscript&gt;. There ain't no going back to the farm for this old boy ! </p>
<p align="justify">So what can be done using &lt;cfscript&gt; code that cannot be done using tag script ? Once you find-out the &quot;.&quot; is the same as &quot;[&quot; &quot;]&quot; when coding variabled references you soon begin to appreciate the power and flexibility of Java and hence &lt;cfscript&gt; code. Any time you could code a &quot;.&quot; for a variable name that same variable name could be coded using &quot;[&quot; &quot;]&quot; instead and guess what, the code becomes far more powerful as a result.</p>
<p align="justify">When no Mappings are used then everybody who uses the code can instantly install and use the code without having to worry about what was forgotten before the code was executed the first time.</p>
<p align="justify">Instead of custom tags I use CFC's. The problem with CFC's, of course, is the fact that one must know the CFC path in order to use them at runtime. So just to make things more fun and interesting I code an abstract CFC method that allows me to instantiate my CFC's without having to know the relative path to the CFC at runtime. This technique allows me to move my CFC's around for whatever purpose I might find desirable without having to change a lot of code or without having to think about it much. There is a slight performance cost to achieve this level of ease-of-use but then I don't mind a slight performance hit to achieve flexibility to a certain degree. </p>
<p align="justify">There are additional techniques one can employ to make one's code easier to maintain as well as more powerful at runtime. Stay tune for future Blog posts on this topic. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> uses all the tricks and techniques I have learned over the past 10+ yrs of my personal ColdFusion development experience as well as my past 30 years of software development expertise. </p>
<p align="justify">Very soon now I will be able to use <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> to help code the rest of the system. The first priority after the User Manager is minimally functional is to code the Forms Manager. The Forms Manager will allow me to quickly and easily code FORM objects in an intelligent reusable way so that I may never need to code an HTML Form again. Nuff said for now. Personally I cannot wait until the days comes when I can begin to use <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> to code my web based applications rather than having to constantly reinvent the wheel over and over and over without end. It takes time to code the infrastructure of an application completely apart from coding the application logic itself. Someday soon, I will be able to point-n-click as well as drag-n-drop my way to programming health and happiness as well as enhanced productivity and additional profits from my consulting business. I would love to be able to tell a potential client that I can quickly and easily whip-up a web based AJAX App in a matter of hours rather than a matter of days or weeks. </p>
