<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Version 1.1 - The Next-Generation of Content Management Systems.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The thing that makes <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> different from just about every other CMS on the planet is the ability for <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> to automatically "know" what to do with FORM Objects, for instance.  A FORM Object specifies a certain number of INPUT Objects. Each INPUT Object ends up being an HTML &lt;INPUT&gt; tag however <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> "knows" how to properly handle the client-side validation of whatever data type the INPUT Object is able to process.  For instance, DATE data types would follow the pattern of MM/DD/YYYY; the SSAN data type would follow the pattern of XXX-YY-ZZZZ.  Many other DATA types will be defined by the time <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> ships and is ready to be used.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> content authors will be able to create reusable Applets such as Survey Applets that will present the web visitor with a series of Questions for which there may be several possible Responses.  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> automatically knows how to display the survey to a site visitor and how to store the data in the database.  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> even knows how to display a ColdFusion Chart to show site visitors the results of the Survey in real-time.  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will define many more Applet types in addition to Surveys.  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will also allow content authors to reuse parts of the <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> system itself such as the <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> User Manager for instance in addition to others that will be defined going forward.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The design goal for <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> is to empower non-programmers to create high-impact web based AJAX powered web sites with very little effort including their HTML content as well as their programmatic content.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will encapsulate all the power of ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise with Objects that allow content authors to publish WebServices as well as Event Handlers such as File Based Event Handlers or Instant Messaging Event Handlers.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> features an Object-Oriented Networked Data Model that completely eliminates the <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> user from ever needing to think about the database since all data <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> knows how to manage is Object-Oriented and exists as an Object within the database.  <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> users don't need to think about the database at all; they don't need to give any thought to database tables and they never need to know anything about SQL Server or Oracle.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will also all content authors to create Object Schemas.  An Object Schema defines Object Types or Object Classes and how to link them together in the database.  For instance, a content author could define an Object Type of ADDRESS and an Object Type of CITY and an Object Type of STATE and an Object Type of ZIPCODE. Next the content author could define Object Links between ADDRESS and CITY, between CITY and STATE and between STATE and ZIPCODE.  Each instance of an ADDRESS Object would then be linked to instances of CITY, STATE and ZIPCODE objects as these objects are created and stored in the database.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Obviously the sky is no longer the limit with <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> because there will be no limits where <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> is concerned.
</p>
<p align="justify">
It is my hope <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will allow web authors to quickly and efficiently move beyond their own skills by leveraging the power of HTML, AJAX, JavaScript and SQL Server without ever needing to know anything about any of those specific technologies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
At this time the <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Data Model exists; the <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Object Manager exists and the <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> User Manager exists.  Very soon the Content Management System will begin to take shape along with a simplistic AJAX Application Generator.
