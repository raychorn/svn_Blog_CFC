<strong>Geonosis</strong> Version 1.0 - Adding the User Password Manager.

The User Password Manager provides <strong>Geonosis</strong> with the automatic ability to ensure all users are provided with an email that requires the user to "activate" a new user account prior to allowing a new user to log-in.

The really cool thing about <strong>Geonosis</strong> is that any module or programmatic function that is part of <strong>Geonosis</strong> can be made accessible to users of <strong>Geonosis</strong> and can therefore be made part of any web app that <strong>Geonosis</strong> can generate.  This means any web app that <strong>Geonosis</strong> generates will be fully able to manage users using the same technique that <strong>Geonosis</strong> uses to manage users.
