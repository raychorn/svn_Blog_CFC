<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> Version 1.1 - Adding Activation of User Accounts.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The <strong>Geonosis&trade; User Manager</strong> allows a Super-User or Admin Role (or virtually any other Role a Super-User might wish to enable for this feature) manually add users to the list of users who can have access to the system.  Users can also Register via the web, if they wish, however we all have situations where friends or relatives or employees need to be granted access to a web app without that user needing to Register.  In any case, the ability to fully administer the user database is a plus for any subscription based website and so this feature is part of Geonosis out-of-the-box.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As soon as a new user has been added to <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> the system will auto-email that user an invititation to "Activate" their new user account based on the Begin Date and End Date for that user's account.  The Begin Date and End Date allows for a nice level of control over when the user can have access to the system and when combined with the User's Role this allows the site Administrators to exorcise complete control over those parts of their sites for which they wish to grant users access.  New users are auto-emailed once per period, typically this is once per day however the Administrators of the site can adjust this frequency either on a global basis for a whole site or on an individual per-user basis.

<p align="justify">
<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> users will have the option of supplying a password of their own or they can be given an auto-generated password depending on their individual tastes.  Passwords are required to be "strong" in that they must be composed of alpha-numerics and special characters.  Auto-generated passwords are composed of combinations of strong password characters that are constructed in such a manner so as to avoid user confusion.  Some combinations of letters can be confused for similar looking characters and it is those characters that are missing from auto-generated passwords.

The design goal for the <strong>Geonosis&trade; User Manager</strong> is to keep it easy for non-programmers to be able to reuse the entire <strong>Geonosis&trade; User Manager</strong> for their own sites they create using <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>.

The design goal for the entirety of <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> is to keep it easy for non-programmers and programmers alike to be able to reuse as much of <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> as possible for their own sites they create using <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>.

<strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> will turn web site development into a joy for everybody by enabling everybody who can use a browser to be able to deploy high-impact AJAX based web apps as easily as they can use a browser.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> HTML content is treated the same as programmatic content which means <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong> allows JavaScript content to be created and manipulated automatically simply by manipulating easy-to-use objects such as FORMs or USER-MANAGERs or SURVEYs or any other <strong>Geonosis&trade; Applet</strong> anyone might create using <strong>Geonosis&trade;</strong>.
