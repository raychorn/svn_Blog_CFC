<p align="justify"><strong>Here's the Proof that BlogCFC 4.0.2 was indeed riddled with serious Security Flaws </strong></p>
<p align="justify">We here at Rabid Central have had absolutely NO hacking attempts since we locked-down our Blog Site.</p>
<p align="justify">THIS is the proof that BlogCFC was and is just as flawed as we have stated in our previous Blog posts. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>We here at Rabid Central are working on getting our new 64 Bit DB Server Online soon... </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">Picture this, a 64-bit Dual Core  X2 4200+ with 4 GB RAM and 1000 GB Disk Space running 64-bit Windows 2003 R2 and 64-bit SQL Server 2005.</p>
<p align="justify">This Db Server will quite literally scream and it will allow our site(s) to be very very fast.</p>
<p align="justify">The delivery schedule for this server will be approx. 6 weeks from today which leaves us more than enough time to locate and purchase the remaining hardware for this server and for our replacement computer which will be an AMD FX-60   which will be used in our back-office to support our development efforts. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Development of Rabid_AJAX proceeds... </strong></p>
<p align="justify">We have been working hard on Rabid-AJAX cooking up new and interesting ways to obscure and hide JavaScript content from those who may wish to see how we are doing things.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep in mind the fact that when Rabid_AJAX is finally ready as a product YOU can download and use it will provide YOU too with the means to keep your valuable JavaScript content safe and secure from those who might with to steal your ideas from you.</p>
<p align="justify">We here at Rabid Central take Intellectual Property Protection very seriously, very seriously indeed. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>We have even found a slick way to encrypt JavaScript content  </strong>   </p>
<p align="justify">Yes, during our many travels around the Internet we have found and reverese engineered a slick way to further obfuscate JavaScript code through the use of a replacement cipher we plan on enhancing by making it into an adaptive replacement cipher.</p>
<p align="justify">You see the major weakness of a replacement cipher is the fact that the encrypted code tends to be easily decipherable because every occurance of a symbol is always the same and this tends to lead to easily breaking such an encoding technique. Adaptive encoding techniques would tend to cause the encrypted codes appear random from occurance to occurance and in this way it would be far more difficult to decipher the encrypted codes back into the original JavaScript. </p>
<p align="justify">Keep in mind our JavaScript delivery system will first compress the whitespace our of the original code and then each JavaScript function will be obfuscated by replacing long variable and private function names with very short variable and function names to obscure the meaning behind the code. You see, humans tend to encapsulate the meaning of their code in the names of the variables and the names of the functions. Once the long variable and function names have been replaced with shorter variants the meaning behind the codes will be gone. </p>
<p align="justify">So after the whitespace and variable and function names have been obscured the JavaScript code will be ready to be turned into encrypted objects. The encrypted objects will encapsulate the encrypted codes for each JavaScript function in such a way so that once decrypted the function will be wrapped within an Object. The function that performs the decryption process will NEVER appear anywhere near any encrypted codes. We have learned some interesting ways to disguise JavaScript codes in places one would not normally think of looking and since we will be using an AJAX system we can easily download our JavaScript code using methods that effectively hides how our JavaScript code is being delivered. We can easily spread-out the decryption methods among various JavaScript funcitons none of which will indicate what their purposes are so even if YOU were to see this code it would not be at-all obvious as to why this code was written.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Yes, we are going to change the way JavaScript is delivered to YOUR browser in ways that will forever change the face of the universe.</strong> Mankind will once again be free to develop JavaScript without the fear that unethical people will be able to simply copy their codes or reverse-engineer their codes. You see, some of us spend a lot of time developing our JavaScript and we simply do not wish to just give that code away to all those who wish to see it. </p>
<p align="justify">It does not matter to us, the producers of Rabid_AJAX, that nobody else in the world might wish to use our techniques and it does not matter if we make any money doing this or not. It is enough that WE will be free to code and deliver our JavaScript based AJAX powered applications without having to just give our codes away for all to use and abuse without our permisson. </p>
